,Positive,Neutral,Negative
0," On the positive side, again, we're seeing real estate demand going up, interest rates continue to be low","  As   a   remainder,   all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode"," But then suddenly, we had the lockdown again, in May, and almost part of June almost half the quarter, if not more had, again kind of was a result of shutdown due to which volumes got affected in the total industry"
1," But again, on the positive side, we believe that the Axle Load Norms, the additional capacity that was created, possibly has come off now and we could see fresh demand", And there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes,"   Pricing   continues   to   be   a   challenge,   because   you   know,   the   industry unfortunately seems to be using pricing as a method of acquiring customers"
2,"  The second bit is on the Light Commercial Vehicle front, if you look at the LCV markets, they have been pretty stable, and our market share has actually grown about 20%"," Should you need assistance during the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing '*' then '0' on your touchtone phone"," I've been mentioning that over the last few quarters, unfortunately, the volumes are very low"
3," But we, at the moment, believe that with the vaccinations going on and the familiarity that we as a country have on the lockdown and the opening up, we believe that we should be able to cope much better", Please note that this conference is being recorded," At the same time, what we have been doing is to ensure that we don't pump the dealerships with inventory; there was some amount of inventory that happened in the month of May, because suddenly, things are closed down, right"
4," So, LCV business has been doing well it has been growing, it has contributed to the bottom line", I now hand the conference over to Mr," So, practically if you look at it schools were shut, most of the offices were shut so and state transport undertakings are only predominantly operating within the city"
5," Similarly, aftermarket and parts, defense, as well as power solutions business have actually kind of helped to bring in revenues and also improve the margins because these are much higher margins than the traditional M&HCV business", Jinesh Gandhi from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited,"  Non-truck roughly 30%, 35% Hitesh"
6," As the export market start to grow, or open up, we believe that we will see a growth in exports as well", Thank you and over to you sir,
7," So, I think we are quite positive that if the COVID scenario were to come off, we could see quite a bit of growth happening", would like to welcome you all to 1Q FY22 Post-Results Conference Call of Ashok Leyland,
8, We are expecting that in the second half steel prices should go up, Ashok Leyland is represented by Mr,
9, But I think our team has been managing pretty well, Gopal Mahadevan – Whole time Director and CFO and Mr,
10," Overall, we have also been keeping our costs very tight, as has been the practice", K,
11, And things look to be easing out, M,
12," But on the positive side, we have seen that in the month of April, when things were opened up, we did see a sudden spurt   in   demand", Balaji – Vice President (Corporate Finance),
13," We have taken price increases both in the 4 th Quarter and in the 1st Quarter, I think approximately of about 2% each", We will start the session with the opening comments from the management following the Q&A,
14," Even in the second half of the BS-IV deployment, the vehicle performance was far, far superior than what was in the industry", I would hand over the call to Mr,
15, We will get to see the benefits of modularity when the volumes start to chug-in, Mahadevan,
16," So, I think there's a lot of benefits that we'll see aggregating but we'll have to also wait for the volumes to scale up"," Over to you, sir",
17," So, we hopefully will see that things stabilize as we move forward", I will just keep my comments very brief but try to be as pertinent as possible,
18," So, we are seeing a lot of traction on the ground"," I think most of you have also attended the Investor Meet that we had just about 10 days ago, on Switch where we discussed about the plans that we have for the electric vehicles",
19," And if we see August month also growing I think July has been good, August if it starts to grow and if we kind of skirt the third wave"," But still things have to kind of get to the, I would say pre-COVID days",
20," So, once a month of August is over, we possibly will see demand coming back   Sure, Leyland Finance has been doing very well"," So, the total industry volume for Q1 FY22 was 29,158 units",
21, And you know the collection efficiency has been high month-on-month," I'm going to keep the numbers round, it's okay",
22," For the month of June, it was almost at 85% and I think July has even been better than that"," It was just about 4400 units last quarter in Q1, so Q1 of FY21",
23," So, overall, the Company has been doing exceptionally well"," And the second thing I would also say is that while we can compute market share, market share is a confluence of one mix both geographical and product",
24," And one of the reasons for HLFL to be doing well is that it has got a very diversified portfolio, while it continues to support Ashok Leyland for its M&HCV business and it is a crucial partner and I'm not only talking about M&HCV, but also for LCV it's a crucial partner for us"," Page 2 of 16 Ashok Leyland Limited August 13, 2021 The second one is of course, what I wanted to say is that the bus industry is still to grow",
25," So,   the   Company   has   been   posting   excellent   growth   and   profitability"," And remember that this is almost a 40,000 per annum unit industry",
26," So, the rest of the businesses accounting for 48% has actually helped in the margins being better, because   light   commercial   vehicles,   spares,   engines,   exports,   defense,   are   all   higher   margin businesses",  Our export volumes were about 1190 units for the quarter,
27," So, that has also helped in the overall margins"," In fact, even in the rest of the world we are seeing restrictions on COVID, because of the second wave happening, and then now possible third wave and I will just touch up on it briefly as well",
28," And we are going to achieve that we plan to achieve that through growth of M&HCV in domestic, through growth of LCV in domestic, and through growth of both M&HCV and LCV products in the international market"," So, revenues for the month, for the quarter was 2951, the EBITDA was a (-4",
29," Ashok Leyland Limited August 13, 2021 out with product launches, which are making us more and more capable to address the goal that we have set for ourselves","7%), and our PAT was (-282) crores",
30," So, but I think there is a lot of good work that is happening and the strategy for us to have moved into EV is the right one, because that will future proof Ashok Leyland, even while its internal combustion engine will continue to serve the transportation requirements of various economies", ICDs outstanding,
31," Our electric vehicle is actually gaining momentum and we as an important commercial vehicle manufacturer   not   just   in   India,   but   also   as   global   the   fourth   or   fifth   largest   global   bus manufacturer, need to invest into it", seeing happening: The net debt was Rs,
32," And we proved that BS-IV as well when we had completed different exhaust system than competition which proved us, which helped us to grow the share", That's how we are seeing this whole piece,
33," We have been continuously kind of growing our network, continuously working on dealer profitability", We were a 14% player,
34," We found that we needed to course correct there because our earlier strategy was not working, but the good side is we have a much richer product portfolio today both in LHD, RHD, ICV, LCV, M&HCV and even in spares"," So, this market is very promising",
35," In fact, we are far more efficient today in terms of CAPEX productivity than we were in the past", It's not as volatile as the M&HCV market,
36," And hopefully we will be coming up with kind of decent numbers in that quarter, in terms of a forecast I am talking about, not about Q2 Results"," And we are planning ourselves for that, in terms of the demand growth happening",
37,"  Ashok Leyland raised its prices by 12% to 14% and all of us when we went into a call, were concerned, why is it that you folks are raising prices by 14% and how sustainable is that for the growth"," Of course, if COVID third wave comes severe then that’s a completely different Page 3 of 16 Ashok Leyland Limited August 13, 2021 scenario",
38, And 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 were two of our best years," So, this is where we are",
39," So, we're doing all that we can to improve our penetration with the customer, grow our share of business and at the same time, increase prices and improve the product mix and improve the geographical base, this is what we are doing", I'm now going to hand it over,
40," And at the current levels of volume, absolute 100% recovery does not happen but I would also want to complement our sourcing team and our supply chain team who had kind of had the force to bulk up a little bit on steel in the 4th Quarter of the last year"," I know I promised I'll keep it short, but I have not",
41," I mean it won’t serve us through the whole year, but that has actually helped us", But then there are multiple reports,
42," And all we can say at the moment from management side and from the whole team, is that we are doing all that we can and it takes, to make ourselves more efficient even through this challenging times, and given where we are today, we possibly would see a recovery happening, once the fear of the third wave goes away", The second one is of course, we are keeping a very close watch on semiconductor availability
43,," We have a special value engineering project which has been kicked off, last year we had a project for taking out costs across the Company, this year, there is another project to take out cost out of the material, which is alternative material, alternative design",
44,," We are looking at vital essential parts in vehicle, but nothing that will impact the performance of the Company",
45,, There is a whole bunch of people who are working on that,
46,, The second one is of course, something that we have been doing consistently is middle line management
47,," So, every item of cost is being looked at, but at the same time, we also need to ensure that we don't do anything which is very short term and very myopic in nature and we need to ensure that we are planning for the growth of the Company itself",
48,," So, Jinesh, over to you",
49,," But at the same time, we must understand one thing, see this is we need to wait for things to kind of pan out all of this will dramatically change, once that demand picks up",
50,," You know,   and  this   is  not   like  other   businesses   where  it’s   there's  a   personal   ownership",
51,,   This  is essentially commercial vehicles used for commercial purposes,
52,," You know cost for which, there are two ways to look at it, one is to look at cost for which the customer believes that it doesn't make sense to pay or costs that which a customer is willing to pay, which can be an add on to the vehicle",
53,," So, we're looking at both of them",
54,," And finally, one more thing that I would say is we possibly are the only player in India to have launched a completely modular vehicle",
55,,"  No,  I will,  see  the  other expenses there have  been  some  one-off  expenditures that we have provided for these are more like kind of arrangement that we have with the parties, you're not going to see that happening in the 2 nd Quarter",
56,, We would be buttoning down on other expenses there's a team that's working on buttoning down the whole expenditure,
57,," And you know how decentralized Ashok Leyland is and everybody, every business had, and some business owns P&L and monitors it very vigorously",
58,," We also keep redrawing our plans as the volumes keep changing and we see that we work our way through overheads, as the volumes are oscillating, this is the second thing that we're looking at",
59,,  I would say that about maybe about 40 to 45 crores should be a one off,
60,," But let's see, let's wait for Q2, because you see some of them are R&D related, some of them are CSR related, some is foreign currency fluctuation",
61,," So, there's a timing difference that comes in",
62,, And let's hope that happens,
63,,"  Well, I think that's a very interesting question Gunjan",
64,," You see, there are two, three parts to this",
65,," The two challenges that all of us know, one is the fuel prices and the second one is freight rates",
66,, We have seen that happening,
67,," I mean, I'm not giving this as a forward-looking forecast",
68,," So, I think what the truckers are doing now is keeping themselves ready for an upside and keeping themselves ready for procuring trucks",
69,," There's a lot of inquiries on the ground today, there were a lot  of inquiries in April, there were  a lot of inquiries in July",
70,," And I think by August and September, things would be pretty much normal as far as the dealers are concerned",
71,,"   You  see,   there  is  nothing  as  good  as demand",
72,, And there is nothing as good as growth,
73,," And I have been saying this almost each and every investor call, I keep things pretty simple",
74,," If we look at M&HCV trucks, there's nothing but transporting",
75,," You know, so this is again, another opportunity",
76,," I mean, I personally don't expect that we are going to be same like that at some point in time whether it is one quarter, two quarter I don't know",
77,," A lot of truck demand would center around infrastructure, this is another point",
78,, And the second one would be e-Commerce and light loads,
79,," So, you know, the whole industry has been bifurcated after the launch of GST",
80,," ICV composition of the overall TIV Page 7 of 16 Ashok Leyland Limited August 13, 2021 is quite significant today, ICVs account for nearly 25% of the overall industry in trucks",
81,, Tippers accounts for about 25%,
82,," In the current quarter Their AUM is at about 25,850 crores",
83,, Their Net NPA is at about 2,
84,,6%,
85,," So, we don't see any concerns on the collection efficiency",
86,," I think the team has also cleaned up a lot of you know, kind of suppose that was any vehicles which had been repossessed, a lot of repossessed stock has also been sold in the previous year itself and when the pricing was good",
87,," And I think overall the revenues were 751 crores and the PAT was 86 crores, so, a 11% margin",
88,, It doesn't cross-subsidized,
89,," HLFL are taken independently of Ashok Leyland we are not passing on any of the burden to HLFL where you   know,   there   are   any   exceptional   or   additional   provisions   that   are   taken   even   for   the acquisition of Ashok Leyland market share",
90,, They run the business independently,
91,, The second one is the portfolio is pretty diversified,
92,," So, you have a loan against property, you have   two-wheeler   financing,   three-wheeler   financing,   off-road   vehicles   financing,   and   also buyout of portfolios",
93,," Page 8 of 16  I think their book is about 40% is commercial vehicle and, the rest is diversified 40% to 45%",
94,," Ashok Leyland Limited August 13, 2021 The second one is you know what I would say is that, as far as capital infusion is concerned, I'm not too concerned at all with respect to capital infusion in HLFL",
95,, I mean in Ashok Leyland, we are not concerned about it
96,," I know that in 2013-2014 the overall book size, if my memory serves me right was something like about 12,000 to 13,000 crores and today we are at almost 26,000 crores",
97,,"   And   if   there   is   a requirement for capital, we are happy to provide that",
98,," Last year was not very significant, this year again if we have to provide a capital infusion that would be about maybe about 100 to 150 crores",
99,," But we will keep you posted, it is to support growth, please understand one thing, if we were to infuse capital into HLFL it is for supporting growth",
100,,  See that is I would say that that is not going to be significant in terms of the gross margin maybe about ,
101,,"3%, to ",
102,,5%,
103,, But I think that's not just the reason,
104,, I think the reason has also been the mix,
105,," The second part is between, if you look at M&HCV and non-M&HCV business again in the current quarter, we have approximately trucks and buses accounting for about 52% and the rest of the businesses accounting for 48%",
106,,"  Fourth Quarter, I will tell you, it was about truck revenues, trucks and buses, Balaji, Correct me 4th Quarter? if I am wrong, was about 65%",
107,," Page 9 of 16  See, I think there are two things they are a little careful",
108,," So, if you look at the larger lenders, they are very keen to chase them, right",
109,, It's the first-time buyers and first-time users who need to be who people are watching out for a person who has bought a one or two truck or three trucks and then is going full,
110,, And then they look at the moratorium record of the person,
111,," When they were sitting through a situation where, see we must understand this in perspective",
112,," Imagine, put yourself in a trucker position and put yourself in a first-time buyer, first time user position",
113,," You know he just come in, he has bought two, three trucks and suddenly you   have   COVID",
114,,"   And   you   are   sitting   on   an   asset,   right",
115,, I think that will come out when the moratorium gets lifted,
116,," But the point that comes up is almost all the commercial vehicle lenders including two or three banks who have large portfolios, they just want to be careful that they are not getting into a COVID wave three",
117,," I am not too worried about a large delinquency situation at the moment, but I'm not an expert on I am not an expert NBFC or a banker, but I think what they are looking for is what happens in the event that there is a COVID wave three",
118,," If that does not happen, nobody is going to turn in a truck after paying the installment",
119,," So, we must also understand the other thing",
120,," So, what is happening is guys who are possibly having small truck operators, who are actually having the smaller contracts, who are now looking at saying okay, if those contracts are not coming in, let me deploy in market loads",
121,," You know I have seen this, we have seen this as an industry, we have seen this as the Company in 2013/2014, right",
122,, But that was more  a  cycle,
123,,"  This  is  more,  where I am  a  little  more  hopeful  is  because  this is because of COVID, right",
124,," You know you and I are going to, starting point is you and I will start visiting restaurants, cinemas, go to shopping malls, buy products, right and then we are going to see the industry Page 10 of 16 Ashok Leyland Limited August 13, 2021 coming back",
125,, And then you will   have   tenders   from   oil   companies,
126,, Even now there are tenders from infrastructure companies,
127,," But I wouldn't find fault with NBFCs or banks to be kind of cautious when they are lending, because they have a portfolio to manage",
128,, I am sure HLFL does the same thing,
129,,"   And   it’s   same   with   dealers,   when   they   are   doing   dealer financing, there are dealers whom we are supporting, and there are dealers who don't require our support where they have solid businesses",
130,,"  Yes, I can explain that you see, what is happening is, like I mentioned to you the market share is a confluence of two things one is product mix, and more important, the second one is geography to mix, okay",
131,," This is not in defense, but this is more to give an understanding",
132,, This is one part,
133,, And the other part of it is in terms of the product mix itself,
134,," So, there are certain times when certain maybe one large deal happens and we are not able to serve that particular customer, let's assume for a minute",
135,," But let me tell you one thing, we are extremely focused on growth",
136,, We are extremely focused on share of business,
137,, We are extremely focused on customer acquisition,
138,, It’s a good question and I like it when you ask more for a trend than for specific numbers,
139,," Yes, this quarter, maybe our market share was I know you are talking about  the  market share that  we had posted  for  the  current  quarter",
140,, the answer for that,
141,," Sir, my next question is more about the CAPEX part of it",
142,," So, I know the EV side of the CAPEX that you have, has been explained in the previous analyst meet",
143,," But let's say for this entity, the listed entity, how do you see the CAPEX and if you can, and this is largely not for the next year per se, and I don't want a specific number also, but what's the area where this CAPEX is going to be? Is the CAPEX going to be higher than the last three year or if you can give us some color in terms of us to understand the CAPEX intensity of the business let’s say in the next three to five years? And which all area it's going to be? Thank you",
144,," You know, the reason I am mentioning this is, see we are very, I think look at it in a larger perspective, okay, first let me start with the EV business",
145,," The reason why we have set the EV business separately is because it should have its own and this is in the medium term, because every business may require some amount of support but at the moment, we are looking at Switch and its entities to raise capital by themselves and raise debt by themselves and manage their CAPEX",
146,," So, you heard our Chairman say, we are not looking at infusing capital in the short-term into the business, even in the long term",
147,," But if the situation demands it at an exceptions than we may, but it’s not going to be a huge amount of money, that’s for sure",
148,, But at the moment I wouldn’t want to give any forward-looking statement,
149,, We will announce them as the news gets ready to announce,
150,," And that’s why we said, let’s not do it in the main Company, let us do it separately so that there is a separate management team and a separate focus on this business, right",
151,," Ashok Leyland EV has not been very significant so that’s why at the right appropriate moment, we will transfer the small investment that we have made into that entity, and because this require this business of EV will require much larger capital investment, no doubt about it",
152,, But it is going to be self-served by the Switch entities,
153,, This is one,
154,, The second one is on the Ashok Leyland piece,
155,," Let us look at it this way, we have already, we have Hosur, we have Ennore, we have Pantnagar, right and then we have Alwar and Bhandara",
156,," All of these plants have been setup for Page 12 of 16 Ashok Leyland Limited August 13, 2021 almost all completeness",
157,, What we may have to do in these plants is called debottlenecking,
158,," So, when  we  will  do  a  debottlenecking?   We  will   take  up  a   debottlenecking   only   when   we   see demand coming up",
159,," Otherwise we will not do a debottlenecking, right",
160,," We are not going to setup another Greenfield or a brownfield venture somewhere and open up another edifice, that has stopped, I mean that has been completed, let me put it that way with the setup of Pantnagar facility",
161,," There is a lot of work that’s going on saying that how do we reduce interplant transfers? How do we get plants to actually serve their local market so that the outbound logistics cost is coming off? How do we have vendors to develop closer to our facilities so that inbound logistics is also coming off? So, there is a huge amount of work that’s going on this front",
162,," Now so where do we have CAPEX coming in? Certainly, we will put in further CAPEX in LCV",
163,, It’s not just the Dost that is getting linear,
164,,"” And that is why we have AVTR range, that is why we have ‘Bada Dost’, right that is why we have Mid-NOx strategy",
165,," So, we will continue on that",
166,," Of course, now today we  are  in  a different  challenging situation,  but  the  next  way to look at this is geographical expansion, right, so that you actually reach out to customers and not only sales point but also service  points",
167,,"  So,  there is a  whole bunch of digital that  is getting  driven  today,  to service customers, to ensure that uptime of vehicles happens",
168,, The third way of doing this is actually fill in the product portfolios,
169,," So, we have Dost, Dost was addressing a set of customers",
170,," When we had Bada Dost, suddenly we are addressing a different set of customer",
171,," So, that’s another way of growing portfolios, right",
172,," And when I say market, I missed to mention, export markets are also equally important",
173,," So, when we are doing market expansion, market share while it’s in India, volume expansion happens when you grow new Page 13 of 16 Ashok Leyland Limited August 13, 2021 market beyond your geographical territory and that is why we have our export strategy",
174,," In M&HCV if there is a debottlenecking required or some new product development for a new variant, certainly we will invest there, but we are not seeing big bang investments of any facilities coming up",
175,, We wanted to kind of relay that we are with you,
176,," And would the CAPEX be in the same range as the previous three, four years, I think if we believe so, we have not been very heavy on CAPEX at all, after 2012-2013, if you remember every year it has been less than four figures and we will continue to be doing that",
177,,"  I have just taken my second shot of COVID so let it settle down and then possibly once its settles down, we will give you a forecast",
178,, Let second quarter go through we will understand how the industry demand patterns are going,
179,, Today all of us who are attending this call are ordering a lot of stuff through e-Commerce websites than we were doing two years back,
180,," If I may joggle your memory a bit, when we went from BS-III to BS-IV and Balaji correct me if I am wrong, this was in April 17, right, 2017?  Yes",
181,, Why was it so? It was because there was a demand, there was an inherent demand that was running this
182,," Today for us to  take  a  2%  price increase we  need  to  be  kind  of  gauging  the  market and taking decision because this is not, today this is not a cost-plus industry",
183,," So, again I am telling you, all of this is a factor of the demand",
184,," What we have been doing is, we have   not   been   just   fighting   the   skirmishes   on   pricing,   because   that   will   take   you   with   the customer only up to the signing of the invoice",
185,," So, there is a lot more that we would be possibly bring to the table when we are serving our customer",
186,,  That’s right,
187,,"  Yes, because at the level of volume, it is becoming difficult",
188,," See, understand one thing, inflation Ashok Leyland Limited August 13, 2021 recovery can happen through multiple ways, it can be done on product-to-product basis, it can be done through a mix, it can be done through a larger aggregation of absolute gross profit which can give us operating leverage to the bottom-line, right",
189,," So, there are a multiple ways to do this",
190,," So, if I may take that as the last question",
191,, And with those words I will now hand it over back to the moderator,
