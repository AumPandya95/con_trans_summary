       " ' Over the last seven, eight years, you have seen that whenever demand goes up, the freight rates also kind of naturally adjust and that happens because the underlying industry have goods to be transported',\n",
       " ' So, I think what the truckers are doing now is keeping themselves ready for an upside and keeping themselves ready for procuring trucks',\n",
       " \" There's a lot of inquiries on the ground today, there were a lot  of inquiries in April, there were  a lot of inquiries in July\",\n",
       " ' So, we are seeing a lot of traction on the ground',\n",

       " \" I mean, I personally don't expect that we are going to be same like that at some point in time whether it is one quarter, two quarter I don't know\",\n",
       " ' But I think we would actually see that you know, the demand for bus is also coming',\n",
       " ' A lot of truck demand would center around infrastructure, this is another point',\n",

       " ' So, you know, the whole industry has been bifurcated after the launch of GST',\n",

Is the CAPEX going to be higher than the last three year or if you can give us some color in terms of us to understand the CAPEX intensity of the business let’s say in the next three to five years? And which all area it's going to be? Thank you\",\n",

       " ' So, you heard our Chairman say, we are not looking at infusing capital in the short-term into the business, even in the long term',\n",
       " ' But if the situation demands it at an exceptions than we may, but it’s not going to be a huge amount of money, that’s for sure',\n",

       " ' All of these plants have been setup for Page 12 of 16 Ashok Leyland Limited August 13, 2021 almost all completeness',\n",
       " ' What we may have to do in these plants is called debottlenecking',\n",

       " ' We are not going to setup another Greenfield or a brownfield venture somewhere and open up another edifice, that has stopped, I mean that has been completed, let me put it that way with the setup of Pantnagar facility',\n",
       " ' Today what the management team is looking at, is to see how do we consolidate this and have a much   larger,   but   I   mean   I   would   say   a   more   efficient,   not   much   larger,   a   more   efficient manufacturing   equipment',\n",
       " '   You   know   we   are   putting   our   heads   together;   we   are   looking   at product portfolio, reallocation, reducing supply-chain cost',\n",
       " ' There is a lot of work that’s going on saying that how do we reduce interplant transfers? How do we get plants to actually serve their local market so that the outbound logistics cost is coming off? How do we have vendors to develop closer to our facilities so that inbound logistics is also coming off? So, there is a huge amount of work that’s going on this front',\n",
       " ' Now so where do we have CAPEX coming in? Certainly, we will put in further CAPEX in LCV',\n",
       " ' We are today our LCV is by doing a two, two and a half kind of shift stretch, our manufacturing teams are really serving the demand and we can go up to maybe about 6,000 units a month',\n",
       " ' But I think there is further demand with the launch of ‘Bada Dost’ they account into a completely new segment with ‘Bada Dost’',\n",
       " ' It’s not just the Dost that is getting linear',\n",
       " ' As we have mentioned in the past, we will continuously keep slotting, putting in slots in the product portfolio to address and taking the large share of addressable market, that’s another way of growing the market share, right, because somebody asked me about the question about market share',\n",
       " ' How do you grow market share? The first one is built product which will convince customers to say that “Hey, come and buy this product more than the other product because on quality cost delivery and total cost of ownership this product is better',\n",
       " '” And that is why we have AVTR range, that is why we have ‘Bada Dost’, right that is why we have Mid-NOx strategy',\n",
       " ' And we proved that BS-IV as well when we had completed different exhaust system than competition which proved us, which helped us to grow the share',\n",
       " ' So, we will continue on that',\n",
       " ' The second way to grow market share is geographical expansion',\n",
       " ' We have been continuously kind of growing our network, continuously working on dealer profitability',\n",
       " ' Of course, now today we  are  in  a different  challenging situation,  but  the  next  way to look at this is geographical expansion, right, so that you actually reach out to customers and not only sales point but also service  points',\n",
       " '  So,  there is a  whole bunch of digital that  is getting  driven  today,  to service customers, to ensure that uptime of vehicles happens',\n",
       " ' And the iALERT system that we have is by far one of the best in the industry which gives a whole amount of rich data to the customer',\n",
       " ' The third way of doing this is actually fill in the product portfolios',\n",
       " ' So, we have Dost, Dost was addressing a set of customers',\n",
       " ' When we had Bada Dost, suddenly we are addressing a different set of customer',\n",
       " ' So, that’s another way of growing portfolios, right',\n",
       " ' And when I say market, I missed to mention, export markets are also equally important',\n",
       " ' So, when we are doing market expansion, market share while it’s in India, volume expansion happens when you grow new Page 13 of 16 Ashok Leyland Limited August 13, 2021 market beyond your geographical territory and that is why we have our export strategy',\n",
       " ' And our export strategy is quite different from what it was over the last three, four years',\n",
       " ' We found that we needed to course correct there because our earlier strategy was not working, but the good side is we have a much richer product portfolio today both in LHD, RHD, ICV, LCV, M&HCV and even in spares',\n",
       " ' So, for us the international expansion is going to be crucial',\n",
       " ' Why I am talking all of this is, so if you look at CAPEX, we will make investments in LCV because we see a growing demand there, right',\n",
       " ' In M&HCV if there is a debottlenecking required or some new product development for a new variant, certainly we will invest there, but we are not seeing big bang investments of any facilities coming up',\n",
       " ' We wanted to kind of relay that we are with you',\n",
       " ' And would the CAPEX be in the same range as the previous three, four years, I think if we believe so, we have not been very heavy on CAPEX at all, after 2012-2013, if you remember every year it has been less than four figures and we will continue to be doing that',\n",
       " ' In fact, we are far more efficient today in terms of CAPEX productivity than we were in the past',\n",
       " ' I hope this answers your question',\n",
       " '  I have just taken my second shot of COVID so let it settle down and then possibly once its settles down, we will give you a forecast',\n",
       " ' Let second quarter go through we will understand how the industry demand patterns are going',\n",
       " ' At the moment it is going by logic, if the economy is going to revive, we are going to see demand in M&HCV',\n",
       " ' We are seeing LCV not doing badly at all, in fact it seems that in the second half also LCV will be firm',\n",
       " ' And that has happened also because of the growth in e-Commerce',\n",
       " ' Today all of us who are attending this call are ordering a lot of stuff through e-Commerce websites than we were doing two years back',\n",
       " ' So, we believe that this trend will continue as a habit and it will not fall off and we possibly would see the last mile delivery becoming very important',\n",
       " ' And even for physical when things become physical, last mile delivery  becomes super crucial  and  that’s  where  LCV  demand  will  be  seen,  even  when  the economy growth and the physical economy if I may say so, also starts to grow',\n",
       " ' M&HCV, we believe will kind of the demand will come on when we see the stability in the outcome or stability in the strategy to react to COVID',\n",
       " ' If people, you, I and the trucker are worried that you know suddenly there could be a lockdown after 20 days or one month, nobody would want to invest capital into a truck',\n",
       " ' And that is why I am saying that when we do a call for the September quarter, we could be in a much better position to say, this is how we expect the Page 14 of 16 Ashok Leyland Limited August 13, 2021 year to finish up',\n",
       " ' And hopefully we will be coming up with kind of decent numbers in that quarter, in terms of a forecast I am talking about, not about Q2 Results',\n",
       " '  We need to balance volume growth with pricing, because this business still, because of the low- level of volumes, and I repeat it, things change dramatically when there is a demand',\n",
       " ' If I may joggle your memory a bit, when we went from BS-III to BS-IV and Balaji correct me if I am wrong, this was in April 17, right, 2017?  Yes',\n",
       " '  Ashok Leyland raised its prices by 12% to 14% and all of us when we went into a call, were concerned, why is it that you folks are raising prices by 14% and how sustainable is that for the growth',\n",
       " ' And 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 were two of our best years',\n",
       " ' Why was it so? It was because there was a demand; there was an inherent demand that was running this',\n",
       " ' Today for us to  take  a  2%  price increase we  need  to  be  kind  of  gauging  the  market and taking decision because this is not, today this is not a cost-plus industry',\n",
       " ' But when the demand comes back, believe me it can become cost-plus',\n",
       " ' So, again I am telling you, all of this is a factor of the demand',\n",
       " ' What we have been doing is, we have   not   been   just   fighting   the   skirmishes   on   pricing,   because   that   will   take   you   with   the customer only up to the signing of the invoice',\n",
       " ' After that there is a commitment that Ashok Leyland brings in which is possibly far superior in terms of service, in terms of product quality, in terms of AMCs, right so and in terms of being there when if something is wrong in terms of digital support that we are giving with our sophisticated system',\n",
       " ' So, there is a lot more that we would be possibly bring to the table when we are serving our customer',\n",
       " ' But having said that to answer your questions, we took a price increase and correct me if I am wrong, Balaji because I don’t have that statistic with me readily, but I think we took a price increase in March and then we took a price increase in the 1st Quarter also of 2% each',\n",
       " \"  Correct, you are right, taken price increase in April we have taken a price increase and in July also we've taken a price increase\",\n",

       " ' See, understand one thing, inflation Ashok Leyland Limited August 13, 2021 recovery can happen through multiple ways, it can be done on product-to-product basis, it can be done through a mix, it can be done through a larger aggregation of absolute gross profit which can give us operating leverage to the bottom-line, right',\n",
       " ' So, there are a multiple ways to do this',\n",

      "[{'type': 'question', 'index': 9, 'paragraph': \"Chairman Sir, I'm from Bombay. Sir Resolution No.8 is the QIP of Rs.500 crores, I request you to come with the rights issue rather than a QIP. The dividend of 50 paisa, that is 50%, I would like to know whether you prefer YES Bank model where to give high dividend and QIP regularly and one fine day everybody knows what happened. Another model is the Kotak Bank which gives less than one rupee dividend on Rs.1,700 share price. Rarely does a QIP and grow with its own funds. Pages 4 of annual report, in each of the five years, deposits are more than advances. If more deposits are coming, reduce the interest rate. Deposit grew by 9% where the advances grew by 7%. During the year Rs.41.7 lakhs of dividend and 14,709 shares were transferred   to   IEPF.   It's   the   shareholders   money.   You   should   try   to   identify   the   genuine shareholder. Even if you have to send someone from the nearest branch on 28th September next month Rs.64 lakhs will be transferred to IEPF. In one month do something to reduce this amount. Government is not doing anything with the shareholders money. So, 1.5 crore shares are still held in physical. What are your plans to eliminate physical shares? I also have only two   shares   in   physical   and   it's   not   worthwhile   demating   two   shares.   During   the   year, Page 9 of 22 City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 provisions were Rs.891 crore and net profit was Rs.523 crores. Provisions are more than net profit by Rs.300 crores. NPA will destroy the  economy and economy is not likely to grow in the current year, although our government expects 8% growth. RBI imposes a penalty of Rs.1 crore   on   discrepancies   detected   towards   soil   notes   remittance.   Who   will   levy   penalty   for discrepancies to RBI? Somebody has to make even RBI accountable. NIM of 4% is very good in a pandemic year. All three segments have done very well. I hope you will continue to do well in the future also. Our Q1 was also good for which I congratulate the entire management. Sir, I would like you to continue with virtual meeting even when physical AGM starts next year. Sir, thank you and all the best.\"}, {'type': 'question', 'index': 11, 'paragraph': \"I am Mani Sundaram. Welcome all the directors, Chairman and Company Secretary of City Union Bank. This year being a pandemic year, this year also you have given output maximum. My question is what is the NPA comparison for last year and this year ? Any recovery ? Give more dividend sir. Any expansion plan in ATMs and also branches ? Because money violation is very high due to this period of corona pandemic. I appreciate the services by your staff and colleagues. Thank you, sir. That's all.\"}, {'type': 'question', 'index': 13, 'paragraph': 'I am Abhishek, shareholder of the company. My DP ID:IN30163741359155. Congratulations management on the eve of annual general body meeting.  Sir, I would like to know how is our Bank   impacted   in   these   past   two   years   of   COVID   time.   After   this   Corona   Virus   and subsequent lock down there is no industry untouched after the Covid so any employee have sacked, hired or any salary cut in percentage of any? And was there any salary cut was taken by the management within the pandemic period. What are the cost cutting initiatives that our Bank   has   taken?   What   is   the   view   of   the   management   going   forward   on   sustainable   and profitable growth remain challenging in the coming quarters? And RBI is keen on telling the Banks   to   provide   moratorium   and   certain   measures   they   also   provided.   So,   under   such circumstances, how do you see the net profits? I would request our management to kindly involve on like the concalls, quarterly presentations with the global investors on a regular basis which will increase the business to the Bank? What are the other expenses, legal charges and the audit fees? Myself and my team are running a legal firm in the name of in Chennai. I request yourself to kindly enroll our firm in the empanelment of the Bank and we will be glad to extend our services. I made a requested last year also but I have not received any revert back from our legal team. Since corona period was existing, I also did not made a presence on this. So I would request your goodself to include us in the empanelment. We are not able to see this year annual general body meeting be conducted now. It is more than 100 years I know that. in the notice also did not mention, in the banner also did not mention about this year annual general body meeting.'}, {'type': 'question', 'index': 15, 'paragraph': \"Good   morning   sir.   I   have   lot   of   questions   to   ask   but   our   chairman   has   clarified   all   the City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 questions. So, it is my duty to appreciate the Bank in this juncture. We hope that we will have a physical meet this year. But unfortunately the hide and seek game of COVID and we are still in the grip of COVID-19. So, globally, so many deaths and as our chairman pointed out we have   lost   six   staff   and   I   regret   very   much,   I   convey   my   deep   condolences   to   the   family members.   Because   of   this   COVID-19,   general   psychologically   and   mentally   affected   and frustration and fear of death. So, in turn, lack of interest and enthusiasm in purchasing except of day-to-day affairs essentials. So, the entire retail segment and related small scale industries and unorganic sector is much affected. So the people what they will do? They have to survive. Like   medical   bill   and   education   and   so   on   and   so   forth.   So   ultimately   they   will   simply postpone   the   repayment   of   the   Bank   loan.   It's   easy   for   them.   So   the   ultimate   sufferer   is Banking in this, in both ways; one, it is not able to lend further which is the prime activity of the Bank and because of no expansion of business and absence of new ventures. On the other side, the repayment is not forthcoming and more slippages and gross NPA increases. One Mrs. Jaya Vaidyanathan, recently I heard in Hindu, CFO in some organization. She said that NPA will zoom in the near future. Our Bank was very safe because we have not extended advances of big tickets. We used to talk every year in the AGM also.  Our concentration and more exposure   on   retailing   business   and   small   scale   industries   which   is   struggling   now   due   to pandemic. While this is a temporary phenomenon, last year also I have told, all the accounts, since I was working in this Bank, now retired staff, I know each and every account is backed by either immovable property of either business organization or the residential outs. So, it's a system-driven NPA.  Our Bank is fundamentally strong. Even in this bad scenario,  critical circumstances, we have done the best possible and I congratulate our M.D. and team of staff for their hard work that they are fundamentally strong. That is why I used to see mutual fund garner in the business organization. The mutual funds are accumulating our share. Their fund managers and business oriented. So they feel fundamentally strong and it is safe and they expect very good return in the long-term. That is why they are accumulating. We pray for the early recovery from this pandemic situation and definitely our Bank will outperform and give very good results in the coming years and I express my whole-hearted Onam greetings to Kerala brothers and sisters and customers. Thank you, sir for giving me the opportunity. our staff and employees, my name is Santosh Kumar Saraf. I am from Kolkata. First of all, my namaskar to you, sir. Hope all our directors, all our employees and all our shareholders who are attending today’s meeting are safe and in good health. I express my condolence to those employees who left us in the last year COVID time. I wish to god please give me om shanti, om shanti and help family make strong to fight and come out of this hard situation, sir. And sir, thanks management to announce very good dividend in line with RBI guideline. I hope that we will increase in the future sir. Also, I thank the management that last year our CASA deposit increased by 27% to Rs.12,981 crores. In this regard, I want to know how much amount in the savings account sir. Next sir, we have 5,040 employees. Hope all are vaccinated. If anyone not taken, what step are you taking? I request you to those who have not taken vaccine, please stop Page 11 of 22\"}, {'type': 'question', 'index': 17, 'paragraph': 'Respected chairman, all the distinguished board members, and my fellow shareholders, and'}, {'type': 'question', 'index': 19, 'paragraph': 'I congratulate the management for the satisfactory performance for the year 2021. All the City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 them come to office and work. Because in Kerala, the situation is very bad. In India, 50% patients come from Kerala. I hope if they come without vaccine, the others will be affected. I request them to go to the private hospital with their families’ sir. Next I want to know what step you have taken for our building. In our building, is there rain water harvesting and use of its water and reduce fresh water consumption. Next sir, regarding renewable energy, I want to know what step you have taken? Are you installing solar panel on the roof or anywhere to become self-dependent in power supply sir? I want to know what steps have you taken in our offices to reduce use of single plastic because single use plastic is bad for our environment sir? How many percentage of our employees still work from home and what infrastructure facilities provided so they can work in coordination with each and other? Sir, lastly, I pray again for my chairman, all my directors, all my company staff, employees, customers for a healthy and safe life, happiness, wellness and prosperous 2021. Last I request you, sir, continue with video conference   meeting   so   I   can   attend   from   Kolkata,   somebody   can   attend   from   Bombay, somebody can attend from Salem. And also, our directors are attending from their homes. I wish and hope you will continue with this. If a physical meeting is held, not possible for video conference meeting. So I request you to please allot 15-20 minutes make a special session for pan India shareholders so they can express their views and wish for you long life, sir. Hope our Bank will improve in your leadership. Thank you sir for giving me time. economic parameters like 9% growth in deposits, 8% growth in to business, 7% increase in total asset, 9% growth in net interest income, 11% growth in gross profit, 25% growth in net profit, return on asset at 2.15%, return on equity at 10.73%, net interest margin at 4%, EPS at 8.03, etc., all point to a fairly good performance amidst the impact of pandemic on the Indian economic activities. I also appreciate the need-based manner in which the CSR funds to the extent of Rs.10.95 crores have been spent during the year. Particular mention must be made about   desilting   of   many   tanks   in   Pachiyappan   area   in   Kumbakonam,   Thirukollikadu, Thirunagar, etc., on the picture shown in balance sheet before the work started and after the work was over underlines the effective use of the fund and besides the donation of oxygen concentrators to hospitals in Thanjavur, Pudukottai, Nagapattinam and various places. And also, the building community hall at Amar Seva Sangam in Tenkasi area and Swachh Bharat providing toilet facilities at public places and at various schools and stress on waste to energy is   a   special   mention.   Net   Banking   facilities,   artificial   intelligence   usage,   mobile   Banking, online   transfer   of   funds   and   digital   channels   are   quite   appreciable.   Sir,   while   the   cost   of deposits reduced to 5.36% from 6.2%, yield on advances declined to 9.91% from 10.76% due to the introduction of the ECLGS scheme with capping of 9.2% and gold loan at lower interest. Please   throw  more   light   on   this.   Segments   advances  as   per   guidelines  to   priority  section, agriculture, MSME sector and weaker sections and these sectors, the Bank should exercise more   caution.   The   capital   adequacy   ratio   is   much   more   than   the   RBI   Basel-III   norm stipulation. And our paid up capital is Rs.73.81 crores and net worth is Rs.5,799 crores. And there   is   a   deposit   growth   and   collection   efficiency   also   is   up   to   the   expectation.   In   the circumstances, why the Bank seeks the shareholders’ approval for issue of equity shares of Page 12 of 22 City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 Rs.500 crores with the face value of Re.1 and at prevailing market rate to qualified institutional investors. Of course,  it is an enabling resolution, but still why should the  Bank go in for increasing the capital base? On gross NPA and net NPA, the provisioning made as at 31 st March   was   adequate   or   any   extra   provisioning   is   necessitated   by   this   time,   what   is   the provision coverage ratio at present? Operational efficiency and cost reduction should be the watch word hereafter. Any fresh slippages on the loan book, slippage into a closing advance percentage wise, restructured loan percentage wise, where it stands today. RBI has fined Bank of Rs.1 crore citing non-compliance on lending to agriculture sector, micro, small and medium enterprises, educational loans on account of waiver of margins and security requirements. It is not Rs.1 crore that matters, but certainly a lapse on the part of management. In spite of the corona effect and all these things, the Bank is doing very well and congratulations to all the staff for their excellent work because the Bank has about 6,000 staff as on date and they are all doing very well and I am a regular client of Sivananda Colony, Coimbatore branch and I am happy the customer service is excellent. So, I take this opportunity to record my sincere thanks to the management. Thanking you, sir.'}, {'type': 'answer', 'index': 21, 'paragraph': \"Esteemed   shareholders   of   our   Bank,   chairman   and   colleagues   on   the   board   of   the   Bank, Statutory Auditors, Secretarial Auditors and each and every one of you participating in this e- AGM today, I convey my namaskaars to all of you for participating in this meeting. Answering the questions from the shareholders during the annual general body meeting had always been a pleasure for me. It in fact reinforces the amount of the affection. Each and every shareholders and every stakeholder is an asset of our Bank. And I take this opportunity to thank all the shareholders who have now come to express their opinion. And I would like to give my answers and explanations for all the questions possible as much as I could record during your discussions. So we had Mr. Bhesania who is first. He in fact made a point on regulations and particularly on the QIP resolution, “Why we are going for QIP, why not for the rights issue?” “And what is the model of the dividend which we are looking into basically compared with a couple of other Banks?” Basically, as we have told in the notice which is basically on enabling resolution. For the past six or seven years, every year we are getting your approval. But we use it only when it is absolutely necessary and also depending upon the opportunities available. Sometimes let's say for various reasons raising capital through QIP may be beneficial to the Bank. We will consider all the aspects and also take your view and also went through a couple of rights issue in the past. So we keep all the options open and take a call depending upon what is in the best interest of the Bank. Anyway, this is only an enabling resolution. We will use it only when it is absolutely necessary and also compare favorably with the other options. So, we are just taking it as an enabling resolution. It doesn't really mean that we will be utilizing it this year or not. We don't know. Let's say we keep all the paper works ready so that if at all it is needed, we may go for it. But it is only an enabling resolution. Page 13 of 22 City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 Mr. Bhesania also spoke about the deposit growth is more than the advance growth rate. “Why don't you reduce the rate of interest for the deposits and all?” It's a very fine balance. Let's say our ALCO committee looks into this aspect on continuous basis. It is very difficult to align your deposit growth and advances growth in absolute harmony. So sometimes your deposit grows than the advance growth rate actually. Also, we have to take into consideration the general economic environment, interest rate cycle and all such things depending upon that we do. But whenever there is a decreasing interest rate cycle, our deposit rates also aligns with the overall interest rate cycle and you have seen the cost of deposits and funds also have come down in the last year which is our chairman also spoke during his address. At the same time, depositors will feel that like they are getting a raw deal. So we have to balance everything in tune with the market realities and the interest rate cycle. We will be taking a call, but your point is well taken and we will keep it for our future references.  And Mr. Bhesania also added about “The fund is going to particularly the unclaimed dividend and all and also shares are getting transferred to the investor educational fund and all and it's the shareholders money which we have to take extra efforts and all?” Absolutely sir ! We are doing everything under our control to contact those shareholders. Sometimes, let's say the shareholders have moved away from their address on the record, there are various reasons which are beyond our control. Only when it is becoming absolutely not possible for us to identify   the   shareholder,   we   are   doing   everything   possible   including   going   for   the advertisements and contacting through various other options available and all, we are doing that. And it is getting transferred only when it is absolutely becoming impossible for us to trace them and give it to that. But your point is well taken on that. On eliminating the physical shares also, we are continuously taking all our efforts but as you yourself agreed, ultimately it becomes the choice of the shareholder, the cost which he feels whether it is worth or not and all. So, we are taking our efforts, but since it has become any transfer of securities, particularly through market sale and all, since it can happen only through the demat form, it is only matter of time before all physical shares getting converted into electronic format, but we are also taking all our efforts. You  also  spoke  about   the  provisioning.   Yes,   it  was  a  very  difficult  year.   We   had  a  total provision of Rs.865 crores for the financial year '19-20 which increased to Rs.891 crores for financial year '20-21, of which financial year '19-20, we had about Rs.631 crores for NPA and Rs.125 crores provision for COVID. This year we made about Rs.599 crores for the NPA and Rs.31 crores for infusion for COVID. As chairman also mentioned, since you had moratorium for first nine months and also during the COVID pandemic there were backlogs in the court procedures because courts and all were locked. So there is some slackness in terms of the recovery of the NPA which will get normalized as we proceed forward. And also, Mr. Saraf spoke about RBI penalty on cash deposits. And also congratulated on 4% net   interest   margin.   And   congratulated   for   performance   in   all   segments.   And   also congratulated for the first quarter performance. And also he expressed that to continue to the virtual AGM. So, we will take a call depending upon the instructions made available by the Page 14 of 22 City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 both Department Of Company Affairs, SEBI and all. All the norms will be taken into account before taking a call. Anyway, we keep your suggestion on mind. Then, we had Mr. Mani Sundaram who gave comparison provisions which I just gave the numbers to you. And also, wanted us whether we can give more dividend and all. Banking is a business when the assets grow and the Bank grows, you need the continuous infusion of the capital particularly for both future growth and also for the future requirement. And there are also clear cut guideline from RBI metrics on how much dividend we are giving and all. We take into account particularly like what is the regulatory guideline and also the requirement of the future and all. Fortunately, since we had adequate capital even during the onset of the pandemic, when many Banks had to go for capital raising on urgent basis, we had a luxury of not diluting the capital particularly during this pandemic year. So we take all the contingencies into account and all the regulatory factors into account and we take a call on that. “Expansion plan on branches?” Till financial year '19 for the previous years, we had about incremental branches of 50 per year. Our chairman said we had only two branches got opened in the last year. So, this year we are waiting and watching. We will be firming up how much of branch we will be opening in the fourth quarter and all. We also need to take into account how the third wave if at all any going to be there. So we will take appropriate call looking into the environment on step-by-step basis. And Mr. Mani Sundaram also asked about “What are all the necessary steps the Bank had taken to take care of the staffs on COVID.?” Chairman explained in detail what are all the steps we have taken. In fact, we worked closely with the government and arranged for vaccination and all. We also explained to you that 99% of the staff members who are eligible have already been vaccinated and things like that. During the lockdown period, we had enabled working from home, reduced man hours, working in shifts and also taking the COVID vaccination. The chairman also outlined in his speech. So, thanks for   your   concern   for   our   employees   particularly   on   this   front.   We   took   whatever   in   our capacity to take care of these things. We   had   Mr.   Abhishek   who   is   also   a   lawyer.   He   also   congratulated   the   Bank   on   the performance, dividend, the profit and multiple things. He also asked about “What are all the plans the Bank has for the COVID and all?” I explained, we are keeping a close watch on that. He   also   asked,   “Any   salary   cut   or   sacking   of   employees   and   all?”   No.   It   will   be   totally inhuman   to  talk   about   the  salary   cut   or   sacking  and  all,   particularly   during  the   period   of pandemic, particularly the employees who are with us in a dedicated passion for so many years and all and who plan to have their careers with us and all. Banking being a service industry particularly when the employees need to have a direct contact with the staff members, those options may be discussed only when it becomes absolutely necessary, by god's grace, things did not happen so that. In fact, chairman also explained how we took care of even contract employees and watchmen and all when government allowed CSR funds can be utilized for giving some COVID-related incentives to them. We also used about Rs.90 lakhs to Rs.1 crore for that particular thing. So, we did not think of any salary cuts or sacking. Even though there was a shot in the financial year '19-20, we were able to show increased growth and also the Page 15 of 22 City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 profitability even better than what we originally thought during the year beginning. So we did not consider any salary cuts or sacking or whatever it is. On  “cost  cutting  front?”  we   have  tried  various  efforts.   Wherever  the   efficiency  is  needed particularly including things like the rent, using the productivity of technology and all, we have been doing that and some amount of benefit we were able to see that on that front. He has asked about “How the financial year '21-22 will be and particularly on moratorium what was given in the last year and all?” The things have definitely improved in the current year despite we had the COVID second wave. We hope the COVID third wave should not be there,   we   pray   for  that.   And   even  if   there  is   a   COVID  wave,   we   believe   because   of   the vaccination and other things, the impact will be much lower and all, I think we should be able to have a reasonably good financial year '21-22 in all parameters including growth, slippages and all. The transcript and all are available in our website which we are continuously doing which will also help you to have an idea of what we are thinking basically on a continuous basis. And he also suggested “Interactions with the global investors and all should go.” Yes, we are on a continuous discussion. Earlier and all, we used to go in person. Now the virtual meetings have enabled us to have discussions with more and more number of the global investors. So we are   doing   that   and   we   are   able   to   keep   a   constant   communication   open   with   the   global investors and also domestic investors by and large. And he has asked, “What are all the things we have made to reduce the legal and audit fees and all?”  We  are continuously  evaluating  that  in  the coming  days,  we feel  we  are reasonably managing them. There are also a trade-off. So we cannot compromise on the quality also. When you need quality, some amount of extra premium you have to give. We take all those things into account. And we hope when we are compared with the peers and other Banks in the industry, we are keeping at track on that and ensure that no unnecessary flab is there. And thanks for offering your empanelment. If needed, we will definitely get in touch with you. Mr. Abhishek asked, “Which year AGM and all?” See, Kumbakonam Bank which was started in the year 1904. Then there were amalgamation of four Banks including one City Forward Bank,   one  Union  Bank  and  also  one   Bank  called,   Commonwealth  Bank  who's  assets  and liabilities were taken somewhere in the mid-50s. And in, initial portion the Companies Act of 1881 or 1882 required in those years there were no annual general meeting but they were conducted once in two years and things like that. So, that's why we always mentioned the year in which the annual general meeting is there. And since we had multiple Banks which got amalgamated, as a practice, we are giving only the annual general meeting year and not 115 th meeting or 116th  meeting, like that we don't give because right from the beginning, this has been the practice of our Bank. Page 16 of 22 City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 We had Mr. G. Sankaran who spoke at length about “The impact of COVID particularly on the impact on the Banking industry, how it has reduced the capacity to lend and also the sight of repayment, the mounting NPAs and all problems during the pandemic year and all?” And also, “Despite being in the pandemic year, he acknowledged the Bank has given its performance to the best” Thank you, Mr. Sankaran for your wishes. Particularly being a retired chief manager of the Bank, it means a lot to us and all current employees feel inspired by your wishes as We had Then Mr. Santosh Kumar Saraf. “He offered condolences to our CUBians who passed always. away during the COVID.” “He thanked for the Dividend.” “He also congratulated for the CASA increase of 27%.” He also wanted to look into “What is the savings Bank balance?” Savings Bank balance on 31st, March was Rs.9,228 crores. He also asked about “The steps taken for the employees during the COVID.” And also, “He suggested not to allow people without vaccination into the branches and all.” As told by the chairman, over 99% of our people had their vaccination, and some of them are waiting for the second vaccination and all. Particularly, we thank the governments both the state government and central government and particularly the government of Tamil Nadu for helping us to get all of our team members vaccinated. I also earlier spoke about the other facilities like work-from-home. We currently don't have anybody working from home; everybody has started attending the office. And he also spoke about “Many of the important green initiatives like rainwater harvesting, renewable energy for which what are all the steps we have taken?” “What are all the steps we have taken for not to use the single use plastics and all?” I have to thank him for bringing this important point, particularly when people talk about the global warming, very important things for the sustainability and we should aspire to live in a better planet for next generations. At all our own premises, we have our rainwater harvesting thing. Wherever we are in rented premises, and where the premises where we don't have direct control, we are not in a position to do anything on that front, but we take it very seriously and all our own premises, where we have the entire building, the rainwater harvesting has been undertaken.   In   fact,   it   became   a   law   almost   10-years   back   every   building   should   have rainwater harvesting and all. We are fully in compliance with that. Page 17 of 22 City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 On renewable energy, we started making our own attempts a few years back. We had got handful of branches, where we went for solar panels. So, we encountered certain technical issues. That was our plan to go for solar panels wherever it is possible, but there are certain issues on that. At the same time, we are planning to have our panels with the solar roof on a new proposed building which is expected to come up in Guindy, Chennai. So we are very serious about it and we are taking steps and doing everything which is under our control. And we happily lend for the renewable energy sources like both solar and wind. Though both the segments are doing reasonably well and all, when the windmill started in a big way about a decade back we had a good portfolio on that. And we did not have much NPA from that segment also. Similarly, after the solar started coming, we are very active in that particular segment which I want to inform you at this particular point of time. And thanks for all the wishes. Mr. Saraf also spoke about “Whether we can have over AGM through virtual mode and all.” Let's see how things pan out. Depending upon the instructions from the regulator and the government and also how things move forward, we keep your point in in our mind and we will do the best job possible on this particular agenda. We had finally Mr. K.S. Balasubramaniam who congratulated the Bank for a reasonably good 2021 and all business growth in all parameters. And also he wishes for CSR spending in water tank desilting, providing oxygen concentrator and all the things he congratulated us Thank you very much, sir. explain. And also, for the technology initiatives, he appreciated. He asked the “Cost of deposits and the yield on advances have come down.” He asked us to Basically, it happens in tune with the interest rate cycle. As you all know the central Bank and particularly   directed   by   the   monetary   policy   committee,   they   tried   to   have   a   hold   on   the interest rate cycle. So, in the interest rate, is moved upward or downward and handled by various instruments by the monetary policy committee to ensure that on the mandate available to  the  Bank  to  take  care  of  the  inflation  to  support   the  growth,   all  such  things  they  take decisions on moving the interest rate up or down. Depending upon that the market interest rate, liquidity and all will change which is a market-driven parameter. So, we are into a decreasing interest rate scenario, looks like finally, it is getting stabilized. When the interest rate cycle comes down, automatically both the deposits rates and also yields will come down, and there will be surplus liquidity in the market. Because of the lower cost, once again, the economy will start picking up. That is the way with which things are managed. So, we have to just follow what is happening and align our market rate in tune with the market rates both on cost of deposits and yield on advances front. Page 18 of 22 City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 Mr.   Balasubramaniam   also   asked,   why   are   we   going   for   equity   infusion.   And   he   also acknowledges this is only an enabling resolution. Once again we need this enabling resolution because whenever we have right opportunity or we need not waste time in other paperwork and all. Any permission by the shareholders, the approval will be valid for one full year. That's why we have been taking your permission for the last seven, eight years. It is almost for the last six, seven years we have not utilized that, we will use it when it is absolutely necessary. And he asked “Whether the adequate provisions have been made?” Yes, all the provisions have been made as per the regulatory norms and as per the auditors’ requirement and all. And   he   asked   “About   the   provision   coverage   ratio.”   As   we   have   disclosed   the   current provision   coverage   ratio,   including   the   technical   written   off   accounts   as   per   the   RBI guidelines, is currently about 63.57 percentage. The annual slippage ratio to closing advances for the last five years is already given. In fact, we shared with the investors and it is also on our website during our conference calls with the investors along with our fourth quarter results, we may be having almost equal to whatever we had last year, but we feel the things should get better and we are doing our best to have everything under control. He also spoke about RBI penalty on agri loan, MSME. And he also mentioned that the penalty amount is not important, it's an indication on the lapse on the management. Sir, the point is well taken, we are doing our best to keep us as one of the compliant Banks complying with the all regulatory prescriptions and the law of the land. So this is one exception, which happened which were beyond our control. We take your point and we will do our best to ensure that such an embarrassing situation will not come in future. We are doing our best to do that. I want to record it at this particular point. So he also congratulated the management on the overall performance. So, I think we have discussed about the points almost raised by all the shareholders. I once again thank every shareholder for that. Mr. Padmanabhan since he couldn't join because of the technical problem, he has given about four,   five   questions,   which   I   probably   will   answer.   “What   is   your   dividend   policy?”   So, basically, there are regulatory prescriptions on how much portion of the net  profit can be shared with the shareholders as a dividend. That is the broader prescription. We don't have any choice. We have to be in full compliance with that regulatory prescription. Apart from that, we also continuously make at track, we ensure what is going to be the future growth rate. The point is, as I explained earlier, Banks will have growth on a continuous basis and it will always require growth capital. Even the first speaker, Mr. Bhesania told, if you give more dividend, once again you have to collect it back as a share capital because the capital requirement will be on a continuous basis. So, we take into account all the future capital requirements and take a call both in terms for the growth and also for the other requirement over and above the basic regulatory  prescription  whatever that   is available,   we take  a  call  on  that.   To answer  your Page 19 of 22 City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 question  straight,   it  is  determined  by the  regulatory prescription on  the  cap  which can be shared as the dividend. “Why   the   market   prices   of   our   company   gone   down   below   Rs.150   recently?”   This   is something which we don't have any control. We can only do our duty like what Lord Krishna gave it in the Bhagavad Gita, “Karmanye Vadhikaraste, Ma Phaleshou Kada Chana” So, our job is to do our duty, we are doing everything possible in our control to improve the business, keep everything in the most efficient manner, to have the efficiency and profitability ratios close to the best and all. So, to the market you fit, basically it has a lead or lag effect and other demand   and   supply   and   so   many   general   perceptions.   So,   I   can   only   say   that   on   the performances front, we are doing our best. Even in performance also, some of the things are beyond our control, but whatever it is, we are doing our best to do a best job. When I joined the Bank way back in 2003 over the last 18 years, earlier the market used to give us the price- to-book value multiple of only 0.5. So, currently, the price-to-book value is close to about two. That expansion has happened over a period of time. And the market has taken its time and rewarded the Bank. What we do is that we do our best possible in terms of the performance and then leave it to god which means the market is god. The market will decide and we hope the market will reward it at appropriate juncture. “Why   gross   and   net   NPA   is   going   up?”   So   for   this   particular   year,   it   is   because   of   the pandemic, you had a lockdown for many months. It's the industry phenomenon. On slippage front, showing some amount of upward and recovery is also not happening to the phase who would like to see because the courts and all were also shut down. And now only things are getting slowly back to the normal. So we hope things will start improving from the financial year '22-23. Once the court procedures improve, the recoveries will improve. We are also reaching towards the end of the bad impact by COVID pandemic. So we hope the incremental slippage ratio in the second half will come down assuming that there won't be any third wave of COVID. So, things should stabilize and improve from whatever we have currently. “What are all the steps taken to improve your business and net profit and all? As I told you, taking care of the existing customers, we are trying to improve our efficiency in each and every line item on a continuous basis. So, the growth also needs to pick up because we had almost one and a half, two year period of lull growth and all. So, we are now taking care of everything and also taking steps to improve the NPA recovery through various means. So, once the growth starts and also the slippages stabilizes and recovery improve, all parameters otherwise the track will come back to the normalcy. So, I request all the shareholders… this is one request I normally used to place in the AGM to include the welfare of the employees in your morning prayers, it is very much required on taking things forward. And with this, I think I have answered the questions that were discussed by the shareholders and also one e-mail from Mr. Padmanabhan who had registered earlier but could not join. So, with this a few words, I once again thank all the shareholders for the affection and ownership, which   you   show   on   us.   I   trust   this   affection   will   continue.   Your   wishes   and   prayer   will Page 20 of 22 definitely take the Bank from strength-to-strength and improve all the parameters in that way the shareholders wealth also. Thank all of you to participate in this AGM.\"}, {'type': 'answer', 'index': 22, 'paragraph': 'I hope you are happy with our M.D. and CEO for his response. I thank our M.D. and CEO for his replies.

       "  'paragraph': \"Chairman Sir, I'm from Bombay. Sir Resolution No.8 is the QIP of Rs.500 crores, I request you to come with the rights issue rather than a QIP. The dividend of 50 paisa, that is 50%, I would like to know whether you prefer YES Bank model where to give high dividend and QIP regularly and one fine day everybody knows what happened. Another model is the Kotak Bank which gives less than one rupee dividend on Rs.1,700 share price. Rarely does a QIP and grow with its own funds. Pages 4 of annual report, in each of the five years, deposits are more than advances. If more deposits are coming, reduce the interest rate. Deposit grew by 9% where the advances grew by 7%. During the year Rs.41.7 lakhs of dividend and 14,709 shares were transferred   to   IEPF.   It's   the   shareholders   money.   You   should   try   to   identify   the   genuine shareholder. Even if you have to send someone from the nearest branch on 28th September next month Rs.64 lakhs will be transferred to IEPF. In one month do something to reduce this amount. Government is not doing anything with the shareholders money. So, 1.5 crore shares are still held in physical. What are your plans to eliminate physical shares? I also have only two   shares   in   physical   and   it's   not   worthwhile   demating   two   shares.   During   the   year, Page 9 of 22 City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 provisions were Rs.891 crore and net profit was Rs.523 crores. Provisions are more than net profit by Rs.300 crores. NPA will destroy the  economy and economy is not likely to grow in the current year, although our government expects 8% growth. RBI imposes a penalty of Rs.1 crore   on   discrepancies   detected   towards   soil   notes   remittance.   Who   will   levy   penalty   for discrepancies to RBI? Somebody has to make even RBI accountable. NIM of 4% is very good in a pandemic year. All three segments have done very well. I hope you will continue to do well in the future also. Our Q1 was also good for which I congratulate the entire management. Sir, I would like you to continue with virtual meeting even when physical AGM starts next year. Sir, thank you and all the best.\"},\n",

This year being a pandemic year, this year also you have given output maximum. My question is what is the NPA comparison for last year and this year ? Any recovery ? Give more dividend sir. Any expansion plan in ATMs and also branches ? Because money violation is very high due to this period of corona pandemic. I appreciate the services by your staff and colleagues. Thank you, sir.

       "  'paragraph': 'I am Abhishek, shareholder of the company. My DP ID:IN30163741359155. Congratulations management on the eve of annual general body meeting.  Sir, I would like to know how is our Bank   impacted   in   these   past   two   years   of   COVID   time.   After   this   Corona   Virus   and subsequent lock down there is no industry untouched after the Covid so any employee have sacked, hired or any salary cut in percentage of any? And was there any salary cut was taken by the management within the pandemic period. What are the cost cutting initiatives that our Bank   has   taken?   What   is   the   view   of   the   management   going   forward   on   sustainable   and profitable growth remain challenging in the coming quarters? And RBI is keen on telling the Banks   to   provide   moratorium   and   certain   measures   they   also   provided.   So,   under   such circumstances, how do you see the net profits? I would request our management to kindly involve on like the concalls, quarterly presentations with the global investors on a regular basis which will increase the business to the Bank? What are the other expenses, legal charges and the audit fees? Myself and my team are running a legal firm in the name of in Chennai. I request yourself to kindly enroll our firm in the empanelment of the Bank and we will be glad to extend our services. I made a requested last year also but I have not received any revert back from our legal team. Since corona period was existing, I also did not made a presence on this. So I would request your goodself to include us in the empanelment. We are not able to see this year annual general body meeting be conducted now. It is more than 100 years I know that. in the notice also did not mention, in the banner also did not mention about this year annual general body meeting.'},\n",

       "  'paragraph': \"Good   morning   sir.   I   have   lot   of   questions   to   ask   but   our   chairman   has   clarified   all   the City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 questions. So, it is my duty to appreciate the Bank in this juncture. We hope that we will have a physical meet this year. But unfortunately the hide and seek game of COVID and we are still in the grip of COVID-19. So, globally, so many deaths and as our chairman pointed out we have   lost   six   staff   and   I   regret   very   much,   I   convey   my   deep   condolences   to   the   family members.   Because   of   this   COVID-19,   general   psychologically   and   mentally   affected   and frustration and fear of death. So, in turn, lack of interest and enthusiasm in purchasing except of day-to-day affairs essentials. So, the entire retail segment and related small scale industries and unorganic sector is much affected. So the people what they will do? They have to survive. Like   medical   bill   and   education   and   so   on   and   so   forth.   So   ultimately   they   will   simply postpone   the   repayment   of   the   Bank   loan.   It's   easy   for   them.   So   the   ultimate   sufferer   is Banking in this, in both ways; one, it is not able to lend further which is the prime activity of the Bank and because of no expansion of business and absence of new ventures. On the other side, the repayment is not forthcoming and more slippages and gross NPA increases. One Mrs. Jaya Vaidyanathan, recently I heard in Hindu, CFO in some organization. She said that NPA will zoom in the near future. Our Bank was very safe because we have not extended advances of big tickets. We used to talk every year in the AGM also.  Our concentration and more exposure   on   retailing   business   and   small   scale   industries   which   is   struggling   now   due   to pandemic. While this is a temporary phenomenon, last year also I have told, all the accounts, since I was working in this Bank, now retired staff, I know each and every account is backed by either immovable property of either business organization or the residential outs. So, it's a system-driven NPA.  Our Bank is fundamentally strong. Even in this bad scenario,  critical circumstances, we have done the best possible and I congratulate our M.D. and team of staff for their hard work that they are fundamentally strong. That is why I used to see mutual fund garner in the business organization. The mutual funds are accumulating our share. Their fund managers and business oriented. So they feel fundamentally strong and it is safe and they expect very good return in the long-term. That is why they are accumulating. We pray for the early recovery from this pandemic situation and definitely our Bank will outperform and give very good results in the coming years and I express my whole-hearted Onam greetings to Kerala brothers and sisters and customers. Thank you, sir for giving me the opportunity. our staff and employees, my name is Santosh Kumar Saraf. I am from Kolkata. First of all, my namaskar to you, sir. Hope all our directors, all our employees and all our shareholders who are attending today’s meeting are safe and in good health. I express my condolence to those employees who left us in the last year COVID time. I wish to god please give me om shanti, om shanti and help family make strong to fight and come out of this hard situation, sir. And sir, thanks management to announce very good dividend in line with RBI guideline. I hope that we will increase in the future sir. Also, I thank the management that last year our CASA deposit increased by 27% to Rs.12,981 crores. In this regard, I want to know how much amount in the savings account sir. Next sir, we have 5,040 employees. Hope all are vaccinated. If anyone not taken, what step are you taking? I request you to those who have not taken vaccine, please stop Page 11 of 22\"},\n",

       "  'paragraph': 'I congratulate the management for the satisfactory performance for the year 2021. All the City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 them come to office and work. Because in Kerala, the situation is very bad. In India, 50% patients come from Kerala. I hope if they come without vaccine, the others will be affected. I request them to go to the private hospital with their families’ sir. Next I want to know what step you have taken for our building. In our building, is there rain water harvesting and use of its water and reduce fresh water consumption. Next sir, regarding renewable energy, I want to know what step you have taken? Are you installing solar panel on the roof or anywhere to become self-dependent in power supply sir? I want to know what steps have you taken in our offices to reduce use of single plastic because single use plastic is bad for our environment sir? How many percentage of our employees still work from home and what infrastructure facilities provided so they can work in coordination with each and other? Sir, lastly, I pray again for my chairman, all my directors, all my company staff, employees, customers for a healthy and safe life, happiness, wellness and prosperous 2021. Last I request you, sir, continue with video conference   meeting   so   I   can   attend   from   Kolkata,   somebody   can   attend   from   Bombay, somebody can attend from Salem. And also, our directors are attending from their homes. I wish and hope you will continue with this. If a physical meeting is held, not possible for video conference meeting. So I request you to please allot 15-20 minutes make a special session for pan India shareholders so they can express their views and wish for you long life, sir. Hope our Bank will improve in your leadership. Thank you sir for giving me time. economic parameters like 9% growth in deposits, 8% growth in to business, 7% increase in total asset, 9% growth in net interest income, 11% growth in gross profit, 25% growth in net profit, return on asset at 2.15%, return on equity at 10.73%, net interest margin at 4%, EPS at 8.03, etc., all point to a fairly good performance amidst the impact of pandemic on the Indian economic activities. I also appreciate the need-based manner in which the CSR funds to the extent of Rs.10.95 crores have been spent during the year. Particular mention must be made about   desilting   of   many   tanks   in   Pachiyappan   area   in   Kumbakonam,   Thirukollikadu, Thirunagar, etc., on the picture shown in balance sheet before the work started and after the work was over underlines the effective use of the fund and besides the donation of oxygen concentrators to hospitals in Thanjavur, Pudukottai, Nagapattinam and various places. And also, the building community hall at Amar Seva Sangam in Tenkasi area and Swachh Bharat providing toilet facilities at public places and at various schools and stress on waste to energy is   a   special   mention.   Net   Banking   facilities,   artificial   intelligence   usage,   mobile   Banking, online   transfer   of   funds   and   digital   channels   are   quite   appreciable.   Sir,   while   the   cost   of deposits reduced to 5.36% from 6.2%, yield on advances declined to 9.91% from 10.76% due to the introduction of the ECLGS scheme with capping of 9.2% and gold loan at lower interest. Please   throw  more   light   on   this.   Segments   advances  as   per   guidelines  to   priority  section, agriculture, MSME sector and weaker sections and these sectors, the Bank should exercise more   caution.   The   capital   adequacy   ratio   is   much   more   than   the   RBI   Basel-III   norm stipulation. And our paid up capital is Rs.73.81 crores and net worth is Rs.5,799 crores. And there   is   a   deposit   growth   and   collection   efficiency   also   is   up   to   the   expectation.   In   the circumstances, why the Bank seeks the shareholders’ approval for issue of equity shares of Page 12 of 22 City Union Bank Limited August 19, 2021 Rs.500 crores with the face value of Re.1 and at prevailing market rate to qualified institutional investors. Of course,  it is an enabling resolution, but still why should the  Bank go in for increasing the capital base? On gross NPA and net NPA, the provisioning made as at 31 st March   was   adequate   or   any   extra   provisioning   is   necessitated   by   this   time,   what   is   the provision coverage ratio at present? Operational efficiency and cost reduction should be the watch word hereafter. Any fresh slippages on the loan book, slippage into a closing advance percentage wise, restructured loan percentage wise, where it stands today. RBI has fined Bank of Rs.1 crore citing non-compliance on lending to agriculture sector, micro, small and medium enterprises, educational loans on account of waiver of margins and security requirements. It is not Rs.1 crore that matters, but certainly a lapse on the part of management. In spite of the corona effect and all these things, the Bank is doing very well and congratulations to all the staff for their excellent work because the Bank has about 6,000 staff as on date and they are all doing very well and I am a regular client of Sivananda Colony, Coimbatore branch and I am happy the customer service is excellent. So, I take this opportunity to record my sincere thanks to the management. Thanking you, sir.'}]"
