However, in view of the statutory directions\\n\\nissued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and Securities and Exchange Board of India in the wake of COVID Pandemic\\n\\nwe are holding the Annual General Meeting this year also in the virtual mode. The Bank has provided the Annual Report\\n\\ntogether   with   the   Notice   of   the   Annual   General   Meeting   for   the   year   ended   31 st  March,   2021   in   electronic   mode   to\\n\\nshareholders. With your kind permission, I shall consider it as read.\\n\\nBeing an e-AGM, considering technical factors / restrictions on participation, I would like to be brief in my speech giving\\n\\nmore focus on the financial performance of the Bank for FY 2021 and our Banks continued efforts in overcoming the impact\\n\\nof the pandemic.\\n\\nGLOBAL ECONOMY\\n\\nThe global economy witnessed an unprecedented downturn in FY 2020-21 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Central banks\\n\\nacross the Globe provided liquidity support along with various credit extension policies to a wide range of borrowers. These\\n\\nmeasures increased the momentum of economic activity in the latter part of the year. The IMF (International Monetary\\n\\nFund) predicted in its April 2021 World Economic Outlook that the global economy is projected to grow at 6.0 per cent in\\n\\nthe calendar year 2021. Since April 2021, the global economic recovery has been gaining momentum, driven mainly by\\n\\nmajor advanced economies and massive vaccination drives and stimulus packages. Inflation in major Emerging Market\\n\\nEconomies (EME’s) has risen above the official targets, due to sustained rise in food and commodity prices. The World\\n\\nTrade Organization has projected an expansion of 8% in Global Merchandise Trade although they will remain below the pre-\\n\\npandemic level. Cross-border services such as tourism and transportation are likely to remain subdued till the time the\\n\\npandemic recedes globally, and restrictions on international travel ease resuming confidence of the passengers. A collective\\n\\nglobal effort to fight the pandemic will bring better results, than individual countries fighting alone & the G20 countries’\\n\\ngoal of a strong, sustainable and inclusive growth is within sight and reach. \\n\\nPage 3 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nINDIAN ECONOMY   \\n\\nIn India, the second wave of the pandemic has taken a serious toll both in terms of lives and livelihood of many. The\\n\\nrecovery that had commenced in the latter half of FY 2020-21 was halted by the second wave of the pandemic that surfaced\\n\\nin April-May 2021. The efforts of the RBI and Government in financial inclusion have helped the State machinery in\\n\\nproviding seamless and timely financial support to weaker sections of the society through direct benefit transfers (DBT).\\n\\nThe Manufacturing sector & Mining sector suffered the worst with huge losses in Q1. \\n\\nThe pharmaceuticals sector for the obvious reasons, witnessed a boom aided by the production-linked incentive scheme\\n\\n(PLI) introduced for bulk drugs and medical devices, which augmented the domestic pharmaceutical production and medical\\n\\nexports. The services sector suffered heavily in the initial period and so also the contact intensive sectors such as aviation,\\n\\ntourism, and hospitality. The IT sector displayed resilience amidst the pandemic. FASTags, the facility of cashless tolling\\n\\nwhich was made mandatory in February 2021 resulted in strong growth of National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC). E-\\n\\ncommerce platform witnessed robust growth with rising waves of digitization. \\n\\nWith Covid-19 second showing signs of decline  in  early  June  21,  and  the  likely  availability  of  sufficient  vaccines by\\n\\nSeptember 2021, growth in second half of FY21-22 is likely to pick up which would trigger positive outcomes for the Indian\\n\\neconomy. \\n\\nBANKING SCENARIO \\n\\nTo   mitigate   the   financial   impact  of  Covid-19  related   disruptions,   the   Reserve   Bank   of   India   undertook   several   policy\\n\\nmeasures  to  ease  the  flow  of  credit  at  a  lower  cost  to  needy  segments.   These  measures  include  lowering  policy  rate,\\n\\nlaunching on-tap liquidity schemes and channelizing liquidity through All India Financial Institutions to resolve stressed\\n\\nloans to individuals, small businesses and MSME borrowers. Further, with an objective to provide more focus on inclusive\\n\\ndevelopment, the RBI broadened the scope of PSL (Priority Sector Lending). \\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India continued with its accommodative stance and undertook several measures to arrest the downturn\\n\\nin domestic economic  activity,  to ease  financial  conditions  and  the  functioning of financial markets  while  maintaining\\n\\nfinancial stability and the soundness of payment and settlement systems. \\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India on the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situations, made the\\n\\nfollowing changes at its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting held on August 06, 2021: \\n\\n\\uf0d8 Policy repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) unchanged 4.0 per cent. \\n\\n\\uf0d8 Reverse repo ratio under Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) was maintained at 3.35 percent. \\n\\n\\uf0d8 Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate maintained at 4.25 per cent.\\n\\nThe health of the Banking Sector emerged as top most priority for the Reserve Bank of India as it sought to provide more\\n\\ncushion to the sector already ravaged by the pandemic. The timely measures of RBI have infused a sense of optimism\\n\\namongst banks. Containing measures like lockdown and stoppage of transportation, which paralyzed the business enterprises\\n\\nhad their impact on banks in terms of loan recoveries.  As said earlier plethora of steps taken by RBI and Government of\\n\\nPage 4 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nIndia  like Resolution  Plan,   ECLGS (Emergency Credit  link Guarantee Scheme)  etc.,  would  help both  banks  and their\\n\\nborrowers to overcome the damage caused by the pandemic. These measures along with vaccination drives and a collective\\n\\neffort at the global level to arrest the pandemic are all expected to propel the global economy out of woods in the year ahead.\\n\\nOUR BANK’S RESPONSE \\n\\nWith the threat of the third wave of the pandemic looming large, the Bank continues to remain cautious. Safety measures like\\n\\nalternative work arrangements, creation of awareness among employees, fully sanitizing the environment, providing health\\n\\ncamps for employees and their families, reducing in-person interactions, redesigning working hours through implementation\\n\\nof shift system etc., are taken. During the year our Bank conducted vaccination programmes at several centres including our\\n\\nAdministrative Office covering 4663 employees constituting 99% of total eligible workforce. A high level committee by\\n\\nname “Quick Response Team” was also formed as directed by RBI to oversee the entire developments in the context of the\\n\\nspread of COVID 19.\\n\\nComing to the credit side, in line with the policies of RBI & Central Government, the Bank has provided credit to MSME\\n\\nsector under Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) at a concessional rate to help them tide over the economic\\n\\ndistress. The Quantum of relief provided under ECLGS is Rs. 1,960 crore covering 8,556 borrowers’ upto March 31, 2021.\\n\\nThe   relief   provided   to   borrowers   on   repayment   of   their   loan-dues   particularly   interest   burden,   pursuant   to   regulatory\\n\\ndirections, is a timely help to them to cope with the pressure on their strained cash flows. \\n\\nWe always extend our support and services to all our customers improvising our products and operational efficiency using\\n\\nthe updated technology. At the same time we ensure that our hoary tradition well established by the founders of the Bank is\\n\\nmaintained with no compromise on the core values. \\n\\nMOVING TO PERFORMANCE OF YOUR BANK\\n\\nIn the current market scenario which is largely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, your Bank recorded a reasonable growth\\n\\nrate during the year in comparison to previous year. In the reporting year, the biggest challenge faced by the Banking system\\n\\nwas dealing with mounting stressed assets, restructured debts and NPA accounts. Despite these challenges, the Bank was\\n\\nable to post an 8% growth in its total business, with Deposits growing by 9% and Gross Advances growing by 7%. The total\\n\\nbusiness of the Bank as on 31st March, 2021 stood at Rs. 81,558 crore.\\n\\nThe Net Interest Margin or NIM of your Bank stood at 4% for the year ended   March 31, 2021. CASA stood at 29% of\\n\\nDeposits which improved from 25% in the previous year. Credit Deposit Ratio has recorded 83% at the end of the year. As a\\n\\nresult, the Net Interest Income rose from Rs. 1,676 to Rs. 1,830 crore registering a growth of 9%. Your Bank’s operating\\n\\nprofit rose from Rs. 1,341 crore to Rs.1,484 crore. Net Profit rose from Rs. 476 crore to Rs. 593 crore. The return on assets\\n\\nimproved to 1.15% from 1% last year. \\n\\nPROFITABILITY\\n\\nDEPOSITS \\n\\nPage 5 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nDuring the year, deposits have increased from Rs.40,832 crore to Rs.44,537 crore as on 31 st March 2021 recording a growth\\n\\nrate of 9%. The cost of deposit of the Bank decreased from 6.20% in FY 2020 to 5.36% in FY 2021.\\n\\nADVANCES\\n\\nAs for advances, the position increased from Rs. 34,576 crore as on 31st March 2020 to Rs.37,021 crore as on 31st March\\n\\n2021 registering a growth rate of 7%. The yield on advances decreased from 10.76% to 9.91% during the reporting year on\\n\\naccount of the transmission of the cut in the key rates to the borrowers, as expected of us by the Regulator. The priority\\n\\nsector advances stood at Rs. 20,648 crore as at 31st March 2021 as compared to previous year amount of Rs. 17,507 crore\\n\\nand aggregated to 56% of the Bank’s adjusted net credit which is well above the regulatory prescription of 40%. \\n\\nNON PERFORMING ASSETS\\n\\nThe Gross NPA increased from 4.09% to 5.11%. With the Covid restrictions hampering the legal proceedings we could not\\n\\nmake much progress during the year in the recovery of bad loans. The Net NPA increased to 2.97% compared to 2.29% last\\n\\nyear. As the standstill order was in vogue in the first 9 months, bank as a prudent measure made adhoc Covid provisions\\n\\nevery quarter.   During Q4 FY21 we utilized a sum of Rs. 309 crore from and out of the same towards provision for bad\\n\\ndebts. Thus a net adhoc Covid provision of Rs. 31 crore was made during the year taking the total adhoc Covid provision to\\n\\nRs. 156 crore. \\n\\nINVESTMENTS / TREASURY OPERATIONS\\n\\nDuring the year under review gross investments has increased from Rs. 9,236 crore to Rs. 9,523 crore. The total Yield on\\n\\ninvestments worked out to 8.20%. In the midst of a stressed scenario, I must acknowledge here the redemptive role played\\n\\nby our Treasury department. During the reporting year the Bank has booked treasury profit to the tune of Rs. 233.41 crore as\\n\\nagainst Rs. 159.60 crore last year, a handsome increase of Rs. 74 crore, by effectively manoeuvring the volatile yield\\n\\nmovements and timely sale of securities. Further, the Non-interest income of the Bank registered a 4% growth from Rs. 680\\n\\ncrore to Rs. 705 crore mainly on account of increase in treasury income. \\n\\nNET OWNED FUNDS / CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIO   \\n\\n     \\n\\nThe Bank's paid-up capital stood at Rs. 73.88 crore as on 31 st March, 2021. The Bank’s net worth increased from Rs. 5,253\\n\\ncrore as on 31st March 2020 to Rs. 5,799 crore as on 31 st March 2021. The Capital Adequacy Ratio under BASEL III as at\\n\\n31st March, 2021 stood at 19.52% which is well above the stipulated regulatory norm. \\n\\nREWARDING SHAREHOLDERS \\n\\nBRANCHES\\n\\nYour Directors declared an interim dividend of 30% on the equity shares for the financial year 2020-21 during the month of\\n\\nMay 2021 itself, in pursuance of its constant philosophy of rewarding shareholders. In addition, your Directors have also\\n\\nrecommended final dividend of 20% for FY 2020-21 in line with the extant directions issued by RBI on Dividend issue.    \\n\\nPage 6 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nDuring the financial year because of the pandemic, the Bank could expand its branch network by adding only two more\\n\\nbranches totalling 702 branches and 1,724 ATM’s as on 31st March, 2021.\\n\\nTECHNOLOGY\\n\\nThe Covid 19 pandemic has accelerated the push towards digitalization with greater adoption of digital payments. Keeping\\n\\nin mind the Covid protocols the Bank swiftly introduced “ CUB EASY” a video KYC based account opening Application in\\n\\nthe year 2020, which has garnered tremendous response.\\n\\nThe evolution and adoption of newer technology has led to a significant improvement in deepening the digital transmission\\n\\nservices. During the year, “Device Binding” in Mobile banking app was introduced as an enhanced security measure to\\n\\ncustomers whereby mobile banking app can be accessed only from the registered mobile device. Today, Payment System has\\n\\nassumed great importance and it is considered as the lifeline of Digital Banking and in tune with the trend improvisation\\n\\ntakes place at our end also. Our “CUB All in One App” is now fully integrated with Unified Payment Interface (UPI) & Scan\\n\\nand pay functionalities. Even Non-CUB customers can use this application for payment purposes.\\n\\n \\n\\nInvestment options have been introduced in Net/Mobile Banking whereby customers can make investments in Sovereign\\n\\nGold Bonds, Mutual Funds, IPO / Rights Application through ASBA etc. Our Bank has introduced Interoperable Card Less\\n\\nCash Withdrawal (ICCW) from ATM using UPI in our NCR ATMs whereby customers can withdraw from the ATM\\n\\nwithout   using   Debit   cards.   Moreover   during   the   Covid   19   pandemic   and  lockdown,   some   of   our   staff   members   were\\n\\ncompelled to work from Home. The Bank provided them with secured VPN (Virtual Private Network) connectivity with\\n\\ninstallation of Antivirus and Patch management solutions. \\n\\nRISK MANAGEMENT\\n\\nThe Bank has in place, a sound Risk Management Architecture, established by the active involvement and supervision of\\n\\nBoard of Directors. The Board of the Bank has constituted a Risk Management Committee, which assesses the Bank’s risk\\n\\nprofile and key areas of risk in particular. Under the supervision of the Risk Management Committee of the Directors, the\\n\\nRisk   Management   Committee  of   Executives  functions  to   ensure  that   the  policy   guidelines   approved  by   the  Board   are\\n\\nimplemented and faithfully adhered to.\\n\\nThe Bank has a Risk Management team headed by the Chief Risk Officer, who reports directly to MD & CEO/ Risk\\n\\nManagement Committee (RMC) of the Board. The overall risks faced by the Bank and the risk appetite are evaluated by the\\n\\nRisk Management Department which frames policies and procedures, verifying the models that are used for pricing products,\\n\\nidentifying new risks etc. Risk Management practices have been aligned with the best industry practices and are adaptable to\\n\\nthe dynamic operating environment and market conditions.\\n\\nThe Bank is BASEL II compliant since 31 st March, 2009. The Bank has implemented the BASEL III Capital Regulations\\n\\nfrom 1st April, 2013, by computing the Capital and Risk weighted Assets as per RBI guidelines dated 2 nd May, 2012. The\\n\\nBank presently adopts Standardized Approach for Credit Risk, Standardized Duration Approach for Market Risk and Basic\\n\\nIndicator Approach for Operational Risk. Necessary initiatives have been taken for moving over to advanced approaches\\n\\nunder BASEL III as per the timelines indicated by RBI. The Risk Management Department of the Bank effectively functions\\n\\nto measure, monitor and control all risks paving way for effective Enterprise-wide Risk Management. \\n\\nPage 7 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\\n\\nComing to our commitment to the society I must say that CSR has always remained an integral part of the Bank.\\n\\nThe Bank’s CSR wing “Cub Foundation” is continuing to play a vital role in supporting the community in the vital areas like\\n\\nSwatch Bharat, Health care, Literacy, Rural sports, Community Development & Environment sustainability particularly\\n\\nwater  resource  management etc.   In the  year under  report,  we   have spent   a  total  sum  of Rs.10.95  crore towards  these\\n\\nactivities.\\n\\n \\n\\nDuring the year, we prioritized our outgoes under CSR towards containing the spread of Covid 19. We provided Covid\\n\\nRelief Fund to the various municipalities and Government bodies to the extent of Rs.125 lacs. As allowed by a Circular from\\n\\nthe Ministry of Corporate Affairs stating that any exgratia given to Temporary / Casual / Daily Wage Workers / Security\\n\\nGuards can be accommodated under CSR, we disbursed a sum of Rs.93 lacs to such workers in our Bank. In the current\\n\\nyear, at the onslaught of the second wave of the pandemic, we spent a sum of Rs.3.25 crore towards supply of Oxygen\\n\\nconcentrators to various hospitals and towards Chief Ministers Relief Fund. \\n\\nAs in the past, the Bank has continued its contribution towards conservation of Water bodies, & conservation of rainwater\\n\\nfor groundwater recharge. The project on recharge of groundwater focused on desiltation of older ponds for collection of\\n\\nwater. This was conducted at various districts in Tamilnadu which also covered cleaning and deepening of various lakes and\\n\\nrivers particularly in Kumbakonam, to augment ground water levels and conserve water for agricultural purposes. \\n\\nHUMAN RESOURCE\\n\\nAs on 31st March, 2021, the Bank had on its roll 5,843 employees including 50 Executives. The Human Resource function\\n\\ncontinued to build & provide a cordial and safe work atmosphere to all employees by implementing the Covid guidelines\\n\\nissued by Union Health Ministry and State Government on the staff strength at workplace. The commitment and grit shown\\n\\nby our employees during the testing times has been exemplary. \\n\\nIt also needs a mention here that during the reporting year, the management of the Bank considering the risks and efforts\\n\\nmade by all employees during hard & continuing phases of COVID pandemic, has granted COVID incentive in monetary\\n\\nterms to all employees of the Bank. \\n\\nWhen I acknowledge the sincere services of our employees during the pandemic times, I feel pained to mention that the bank\\n\\nlost six of our Cubians on account of this terrible Covid. I pay my sincere homage to them. \\n\\nIn the context of COVID 19, considering the need to adhere to safety norms & to continue the professional development of\\n\\nits   employees,   the   Bank   has   developed   an   e-learning   Management   System   (LMS).   LMS   is   a  software   application   for\\n\\nadministration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of educational courses / training programmes. It facilitates\\n\\nonline learning process at users’ convenience. Initially an audio video lecture series on various fundamental aspects of credit\\n\\nwas presented by the MD & CEO of the Bank. This has been made available to all staff members. Audio programmes on\\n\\nvarious other topics on banking are underway.   \\n\\nPage 8 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nFurther,   during   the   reporting   year,   the   management   of   the   Bank   has   entered   into   pay   settlements   with   CUB   Officers\\n\\nAssociation (CUBOA) and CUB Staff Union (CUBSU) containing various monetary & non-monetary benefits. In fact the\\n\\nsettlement which is due in September 2021, was advanced and made effective from 01 st  January 2021. Further, the pay\\n\\nstructure of all Executives was also revised w.e.f. January 2021.      \\n\\nI take pride in expressing the fact that our employees always stand committed to win the  trust and confidence of our\\n\\ncustomers by their courteous service. The tireless efforts of our CUBians under the challenging conditions are truly laudable.\\n\\nThe Bank has maintained a healthy work environment right from its inception and it needs to be mentioned here that there\\n\\nare no instances of industrial unrest till date.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\\n\\nBefore   I   conclude,   I   hereby   extend   my   sincere   gratitude   to   the   Reserve   Bank   of   India,   all   Govt.   bodies,   Regulatory\\n\\nauthorities,   Shareholders,   Customers,   business   associates,   my   colleagues   on   the   Board   of   the   Bank,   Executives   and\\n\\nEmployees of the Bank for their continued support, guidance and patronage extended to the Bank in its growth process. My\\n\\nsincere appreciations to both Employees Union and Officers Association for their role in ensuring a harmonious Industrial\\n\\nrelationship.\\n\\nWith the grace of Almighty and with all your support, I am confident that our 116 years old organisation will continue to\\n\\nprogress with added vigor touching new horizons of growth and glory in the years to come.\\n\\nI hope and pray that the world emerges victorious in its undaunted fight against the pandemic very soon. \\n\\nMy best wishes to you all once again.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer session. We will wait for a\\n\\nmoment while the question can be assembled.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nI now invite Mr. Aspi Bhesania CLID 1201250000023508.\\n\\nAspi Bhesania:\\n\\nChairman Sir, I'm from Bombay. Sir Resolution No.8 is the QIP of Rs.500 crores, I request\\n\\nyou to come with the rights issue rather than a QIP. The dividend of 50 paisa, that is 50%, I\\n\\nwould like to know whether you prefer YES Bank model where to give high dividend and QIP\\n\\nregularly and one fine day everybody knows what happened. Another model is the Kotak Bank\\n\\nwhich gives less than one rupee dividend on Rs.1,700 share price. Rarely does a QIP and grow\\n\\nwith its own funds. Pages 4 of annual report, in each of the five years, deposits are more than\\n\\nadvances. If more deposits are coming, reduce the interest rate. Deposit grew by 9% where the\\n\\nadvances grew by 7%. During the year Rs.41.7 lakhs of dividend and 14,709 shares were\\n\\ntransferred   to   IEPF.   It's   the   shareholders   money.   You   should   try   to   identify   the   genuine\\n\\nshareholder. Even if you have to send someone from the nearest branch on 28th September\\n\\nnext month Rs.64 lakhs will be transferred to IEPF. In one month do something to reduce this\\n\\namount. Government is not doing anything with the shareholders money. So, 1.5 crore shares\\n\\nare still held in physical. What are your plans to eliminate physical shares? I also have only\\n\\ntwo   shares   in   physical   and   it's   not   worthwhile   demating   two   shares.   During   the   year,\\n\\nPage 9 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nprovisions were Rs.891 crore and net profit was Rs.523 crores. Provisions are more than net\\n\\nprofit by Rs.300 crores. NPA will destroy the  economy and economy is not likely to grow in\\n\\nthe current year, although our government expects 8% growth. RBI imposes a penalty of Rs.1\\n\\ncrore   on   discrepancies   detected   towards   soil   notes   remittance.   Who   will   levy   penalty   for\\n\\ndiscrepancies to RBI? Somebody has to make even RBI accountable. NIM of 4% is very good\\n\\nin a pandemic year. All three segments have done very well. I hope you will continue to do\\n\\nwell in the future also. Our Q1 was also good for which I congratulate the entire management.\\n\\nSir, I would like you to continue with virtual meeting even when physical AGM starts next\\n\\nyear. Sir, thank you and all the best.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nI now invite Mr. A.V. Mani Sundaram, CLID IN30163741521740.\\n\\nA.V. Mani Sundaram:\\n\\nI am Mani Sundaram. Welcome all the directors, Chairman and Company Secretary of City\\n\\nUnion Bank. This year being a pandemic year, this year also you have given output maximum.\\n\\nMy question is what is the NPA comparison for last year and this year ? Any recovery ? Give\\n\\nmore dividend sir. Any expansion plan in ATMs and also branches ? Because money violation\\n\\nis very high due to this period of corona pandemic. I appreciate the services by your staff and\\n\\ncolleagues. Thank you, sir. That's all.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nI now invite Mr. J. Abhishek, CLID IN30163741359155.\\n\\nJ Abhishek:\\n\\nI am Abhishek, shareholder of the company. My DP ID:IN30163741359155. Congratulations\\n\\nmanagement on the eve of annual general body meeting.  Sir, I would like to know how is our\\n\\nBank   impacted   in   these   past   two   years   of   COVID   time.   After   this   Corona   Virus   and\\n\\nsubsequent lock down there is no industry untouched after the Covid so any employee have\\n\\nsacked, hired or any salary cut in percentage of any? And was there any salary cut was taken\\n\\nby the management within the pandemic period. What are the cost cutting initiatives that our\\n\\nBank   has   taken?   What   is   the   view   of   the   management   going   forward   on   sustainable   and\\n\\nprofitable growth remain challenging in the coming quarters? And RBI is keen on telling the\\n\\nBanks   to   provide   moratorium   and   certain   measures   they   also   provided.   So,   under   such\\n\\ncircumstances, how do you see the net profits? I would request our management to kindly\\n\\ninvolve on like the concalls, quarterly presentations with the global investors on a regular basis\\n\\nwhich will increase the business to the Bank? What are the other expenses, legal charges and\\n\\nthe audit fees? Myself and my team are running a legal firm in the name of in Chennai. I\\n\\nrequest yourself to kindly enroll our firm in the empanelment of the Bank and we will be glad\\n\\nto extend our services. I made a requested last year also but I have not received any revert back\\n\\nfrom our legal team. Since corona period was existing, I also did not made a presence on this.\\n\\nSo I would request your goodself to include us in the empanelment. We are not able to see this\\n\\nyear annual general body meeting be conducted now. It is more than 100 years I know that. in\\n\\nthe notice also did not mention, in the banner also did not mention about this year annual\\n\\ngeneral body meeting.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nI now invite Mr. Padmanabhan. CLID IN30131320794645 has registered but not the joined the\\n\\nmeeting. I now invite Mr. G. Sankaran. CLID IN30044110863723.\\n\\nPage 10 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cG. Sankaran:\\n\\nGood   morning   sir.   I   have   lot   of   questions   to   ask   but   our   chairman   has   clarified   all   the\\n\\nCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nquestions. So, it is my duty to appreciate the Bank in this juncture. We hope that we will have\\n\\na physical meet this year. But unfortunately the hide and seek game of COVID and we are still\\n\\nin the grip of COVID-19. So, globally, so many deaths and as our chairman pointed out we\\n\\nhave   lost   six   staff   and   I   regret   very   much,   I   convey   my   deep   condolences   to   the   family\\n\\nmembers.   Because   of   this   COVID-19,   general   psychologically   and   mentally   affected   and\\n\\nfrustration and fear of death. So, in turn, lack of interest and enthusiasm in purchasing except\\n\\nof day-to-day affairs essentials. So, the entire retail segment and related small scale industries\\n\\nand unorganic sector is much affected. So the people what they will do? They have to survive.\\n\\nLike   medical   bill   and   education   and   so   on   and   so   forth.   So   ultimately   they   will   simply\\n\\npostpone   the   repayment   of   the   Bank   loan.   It's   easy   for   them.   So   the   ultimate   sufferer   is\\n\\nBanking in this, in both ways; one, it is not able to lend further which is the prime activity of\\n\\nthe Bank and because of no expansion of business and absence of new ventures. On the other\\n\\nside, the repayment is not forthcoming and more slippages and gross NPA increases. One Mrs.\\n\\nJaya Vaidyanathan, recently I heard in Hindu, CFO in some organization. She said that NPA\\n\\nwill zoom in the near future. Our Bank was very safe because we have not extended advances\\n\\nof big tickets. We used to talk every year in the AGM also.  Our concentration and more\\n\\nexposure   on   retailing   business   and   small   scale   industries   which   is   struggling   now   due   to\\n\\npandemic. While this is a temporary phenomenon, last year also I have told, all the accounts,\\n\\nsince I was working in this Bank, now retired staff, I know each and every account is backed\\n\\nby either immovable property of either business organization or the residential outs. So, it's a\\n\\nsystem-driven NPA.  Our Bank is fundamentally strong. Even in this bad scenario,  critical\\n\\ncircumstances, we have done the best possible and I congratulate our M.D. and team of staff\\n\\nfor their hard work that they are fundamentally strong. That is why I used to see mutual fund\\n\\ngarner in the business organization. The mutual funds are accumulating our share. Their fund\\n\\nmanagers and business oriented. So they feel fundamentally strong and it is safe and they\\n\\nexpect very good return in the long-term. That is why they are accumulating. We pray for the\\n\\nearly recovery from this pandemic situation and definitely our Bank will outperform and give\\n\\nvery good results in the coming years and I express my whole-hearted Onam greetings to\\n\\nKerala brothers and sisters and customers. Thank you, sir for giving me the opportunity.\\n\\nour staff and employees, my name is Santosh Kumar Saraf. I am from Kolkata. First of all, my\\n\\nnamaskar to you, sir. Hope all our directors, all our employees and all our shareholders who\\n\\nare attending today’s meeting are safe and in good health. I express my condolence to those\\n\\nemployees who left us in the last year COVID time. I wish to god please give me om shanti,\\n\\nom shanti and help family make strong to fight and come out of this hard situation, sir. And sir,\\n\\nthanks management to announce very good dividend in line with RBI guideline. I hope that we\\n\\nwill increase in the future sir. Also, I thank the management that last year our CASA deposit\\n\\nincreased by 27% to Rs.12,981 crores. In this regard, I want to know how much amount in the\\n\\nsavings account sir. Next sir, we have 5,040 employees. Hope all are vaccinated. If anyone not\\n\\ntaken, what step are you taking? I request you to those who have not taken vaccine, please stop\\n\\nPage 11 of 22\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nI now invite Mr. Santosh Kumar Saraf. CLID 1206780000018019.\\n\\nSantosh Kumar Saraf:\\n\\nRespected chairman, all the distinguished board members, and my fellow shareholders, and\\n\\n\\x0cModerator:\\n\\nI now invite Mr. K.S. Balasubramanian. CLID IN30115113526679.\\n\\nK.S. Balasubramanian:\\n\\nI congratulate the management for the satisfactory performance for the year 2021. All the\\n\\nCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nthem come to office and work. Because in Kerala, the situation is very bad. In India, 50%\\n\\npatients come from Kerala. I hope if they come without vaccine, the others will be affected. I\\n\\nrequest them to go to the private hospital with their families’ sir. Next I want to know what\\n\\nstep you have taken for our building. In our building, is there rain water harvesting and use of\\n\\nits water and reduce fresh water consumption. Next sir, regarding renewable energy, I want to\\n\\nknow what step you have taken? Are you installing solar panel on the roof or anywhere to\\n\\nbecome self-dependent in power supply sir? I want to know what steps have you taken in our\\n\\noffices to reduce use of single plastic because single use plastic is bad for our environment sir?\\n\\nHow many percentage of our employees still work from home and what infrastructure facilities\\n\\nprovided so they can work in coordination with each and other? Sir, lastly, I pray again for my\\n\\nchairman, all my directors, all my company staff, employees, customers for a healthy and safe\\n\\nlife, happiness, wellness and prosperous 2021. Last I request you, sir, continue with video\\n\\nconference   meeting   so   I   can   attend   from   Kolkata,   somebody   can   attend   from   Bombay,\\n\\nsomebody can attend from Salem. And also, our directors are attending from their homes. I\\n\\nwish and hope you will continue with this. If a physical meeting is held, not possible for video\\n\\nconference meeting. So I request you to please allot 15-20 minutes make a special session for\\n\\npan India shareholders so they can express their views and wish for you long life, sir. Hope our\\n\\nBank will improve in your leadership. Thank you sir for giving me time.\\n\\neconomic parameters like 9% growth in deposits, 8% growth in to business, 7% increase in\\n\\ntotal asset, 9% growth in net interest income, 11% growth in gross profit, 25% growth in net\\n\\nprofit, return on asset at 2.15%, return on equity at 10.73%, net interest margin at 4%, EPS at\\n\\n8.03, etc., all point to a fairly good performance amidst the impact of pandemic on the Indian\\n\\neconomic activities. I also appreciate the need-based manner in which the CSR funds to the\\n\\nextent of Rs.10.95 crores have been spent during the year. Particular mention must be made\\n\\nabout   desilting   of   many   tanks   in   Pachiyappan   area   in   Kumbakonam,   Thirukollikadu,\\n\\nThirunagar, etc., on the picture shown in balance sheet before the work started and after the\\n\\nwork was over underlines the effective use of the fund and besides the donation of oxygen\\n\\nconcentrators to hospitals in Thanjavur, Pudukottai, Nagapattinam and various places. And\\n\\nalso, the building community hall at Amar Seva Sangam in Tenkasi area and Swachh Bharat\\n\\nproviding toilet facilities at public places and at various schools and stress on waste to energy\\n\\nis   a   special   mention.   Net   Banking   facilities,   artificial   intelligence   usage,   mobile   Banking,\\n\\nonline   transfer   of   funds   and   digital   channels   are   quite   appreciable.   Sir,   while   the   cost   of\\n\\ndeposits reduced to 5.36% from 6.2%, yield on advances declined to 9.91% from 10.76% due\\n\\nto the introduction of the ECLGS scheme with capping of 9.2% and gold loan at lower interest.\\n\\nPlease   throw  more   light   on   this.   Segments   advances  as   per   guidelines  to   priority  section,\\n\\nagriculture, MSME sector and weaker sections and these sectors, the Bank should exercise\\n\\nmore   caution.   The   capital   adequacy   ratio   is   much   more   than   the   RBI   Basel-III   norm\\n\\nstipulation. And our paid up capital is Rs.73.81 crores and net worth is Rs.5,799 crores. And\\n\\nthere   is   a   deposit   growth   and   collection   efficiency   also   is   up   to   the   expectation.   In   the\\n\\ncircumstances, why the Bank seeks the shareholders’ approval for issue of equity shares of\\n\\nPage 12 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nRs.500 crores with the face value of Re.1 and at prevailing market rate to qualified institutional\\n\\ninvestors. Of course,  it is an enabling resolution, but still why should the  Bank go in for\\n\\nincreasing the capital base? On gross NPA and net NPA, the provisioning made as at 31 st\\n\\nMarch   was   adequate   or   any   extra   provisioning   is   necessitated   by   this   time,   what   is   the\\n\\nprovision coverage ratio at present? Operational efficiency and cost reduction should be the\\n\\nwatch word hereafter. Any fresh slippages on the loan book, slippage into a closing advance\\n\\npercentage wise, restructured loan percentage wise, where it stands today. RBI has fined Bank\\n\\nof Rs.1 crore citing non-compliance on lending to agriculture sector, micro, small and medium\\n\\nenterprises, educational loans on account of waiver of margins and security requirements. It is\\n\\nnot Rs.1 crore that matters, but certainly a lapse on the part of management. In spite of the\\n\\ncorona effect and all these things, the Bank is doing very well and congratulations to all the\\n\\nstaff for their excellent work because the Bank has about 6,000 staff as on date and they are all\\n\\ndoing very well and I am a regular client of Sivananda Colony, Coimbatore branch and I am\\n\\nhappy the customer service is excellent. So, I take this opportunity to record my sincere thanks\\n\\nto the management. Thanking you, sir.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThat was the last question. I will now hand over to M.D. and CEO to proceed further.\\n\\nDr. N. Kamakodi:\\n\\nEsteemed   shareholders   of   our   Bank,   chairman   and   colleagues   on   the   board   of   the   Bank,\\n\\nStatutory Auditors, Secretarial Auditors and each and every one of you participating in this e-\\n\\nAGM today, I convey my namaskaars to all of you for participating in this meeting.\\n\\nAnswering the questions from the shareholders during the annual general body meeting had\\n\\nalways been a pleasure for me. It in fact reinforces the amount of the affection. Each and every\\n\\nshareholders and every stakeholder is an asset of our Bank. And I take this opportunity to\\n\\nthank all the shareholders who have now come to express their opinion. And I would like to\\n\\ngive my answers and explanations for all the questions possible as much as I could record\\n\\nduring your discussions.\\n\\nSo we had Mr. Bhesania who is first. He in fact made a point on regulations and particularly\\n\\non the QIP resolution, “Why we are going for QIP, why not for the rights issue?” “And what is\\n\\nthe model of the dividend which we are looking into basically compared with a couple of other\\n\\nBanks?” Basically, as we have told in the notice which is basically on enabling resolution. For\\n\\nthe past six or seven years, every year we are getting your approval. But we use it only when it\\n\\nis absolutely necessary and also depending upon the opportunities available. Sometimes let's\\n\\nsay for various reasons raising capital through QIP may be beneficial to the Bank. We will\\n\\nconsider all the aspects and also take your view and also went through a couple of rights issue\\n\\nin the past. So we keep all the options open and take a call depending upon what is in the best\\n\\ninterest of the Bank. Anyway, this is only an enabling resolution. We will use it only when it is\\n\\nabsolutely necessary and also compare favorably with the other options. So, we are just taking\\n\\nit as an enabling resolution. It doesn't really mean that we will be utilizing it this year or not.\\n\\nWe don't know. Let's say we keep all the paper works ready so that if at all it is needed, we\\n\\nmay go for it. But it is only an enabling resolution.\\n\\nPage 13 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nMr. Bhesania also spoke about the deposit growth is more than the advance growth rate. “Why\\n\\ndon't you reduce the rate of interest for the deposits and all?” It's a very fine balance. Let's say\\n\\nour ALCO committee looks into this aspect on continuous basis. It is very difficult to align\\n\\nyour deposit growth and advances growth in absolute harmony. So sometimes your deposit\\n\\ngrows than the advance growth rate actually. Also, we have to take into consideration the\\n\\ngeneral economic environment, interest rate cycle and all such things depending upon that we\\n\\ndo. But whenever there is a decreasing interest rate cycle, our deposit rates also aligns with the\\n\\noverall interest rate cycle and you have seen the cost of deposits and funds also have come\\n\\ndown in the last year which is our chairman also spoke during his address. At the same time,\\n\\ndepositors will feel that like they are getting a raw deal. So we have to balance everything in\\n\\ntune with the market realities and the interest rate cycle. We will be taking a call, but your\\n\\npoint is well taken and we will keep it for our future references. \\n\\nAnd Mr. Bhesania also added about “The fund is going to particularly the unclaimed dividend\\n\\nand all and also shares are getting transferred to the investor educational fund and all and it's\\n\\nthe shareholders money which we have to take extra efforts and all?” Absolutely sir ! We are\\n\\ndoing everything under our control to contact those shareholders. Sometimes, let's say the\\n\\nshareholders have moved away from their address on the record, there are various reasons\\n\\nwhich are beyond our control. Only when it is becoming absolutely not possible for us to\\n\\nidentify   the   shareholder,   we   are   doing   everything   possible   including   going   for   the\\n\\nadvertisements and contacting through various other options available and all, we are doing\\n\\nthat. And it is getting transferred only when it is absolutely becoming impossible for us to trace\\n\\nthem and give it to that. But your point is well taken on that.\\n\\nOn eliminating the physical shares also, we are continuously taking all our efforts but as you\\n\\nyourself agreed, ultimately it becomes the choice of the shareholder, the cost which he feels\\n\\nwhether it is worth or not and all. So, we are taking our efforts, but since it has become any\\n\\ntransfer of securities, particularly through market sale and all, since it can happen only through\\n\\nthe demat form, it is only matter of time before all physical shares getting converted into\\n\\nelectronic format, but we are also taking all our efforts.\\n\\nYou  also  spoke  about   the  provisioning.   Yes,   it  was  a  very  difficult  year.   We   had  a  total\\n\\nprovision of Rs.865 crores for the financial year '19-20 which increased to Rs.891 crores for\\n\\nfinancial year '20-21, of which financial year '19-20, we had about Rs.631 crores for NPA and\\n\\nRs.125 crores provision for COVID. This year we made about Rs.599 crores for the NPA and\\n\\nRs.31 crores for infusion for COVID. As chairman also mentioned, since you had moratorium\\n\\nfor first nine months and also during the COVID pandemic there were backlogs in the court\\n\\nprocedures because courts and all were locked. So there is some slackness in terms of the\\n\\nrecovery of the NPA which will get normalized as we proceed forward.\\n\\nAnd also, Mr. Saraf spoke about RBI penalty on cash deposits. And also congratulated on 4%\\n\\nnet   interest   margin.   And   congratulated   for   performance   in   all   segments.   And   also\\n\\ncongratulated for the first quarter performance. And also he expressed that to continue to the\\n\\nvirtual AGM. So, we will take a call depending upon the instructions made available by the\\n\\nPage 14 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nboth Department Of Company Affairs, SEBI and all. All the norms will be taken into account\\n\\nbefore taking a call. Anyway, we keep your suggestion on mind.\\n\\nThen, we had Mr. Mani Sundaram who gave comparison provisions which I just gave the\\n\\nnumbers to you. And also, wanted us whether we can give more dividend and all. Banking is a\\n\\nbusiness when the assets grow and the Bank grows, you need the continuous infusion of the\\n\\ncapital particularly for both future growth and also for the future requirement. And there are\\n\\nalso clear cut guideline from RBI metrics on how much dividend we are giving and all. We\\n\\ntake into account particularly like what is the regulatory guideline and also the requirement of\\n\\nthe future and all. Fortunately, since we had adequate capital even during the onset of the\\n\\npandemic, when many Banks had to go for capital raising on urgent basis, we had a luxury of\\n\\nnot diluting the capital particularly during this pandemic year. So we take all the contingencies\\n\\ninto account and all the regulatory factors into account and we take a call on that.\\n\\n“Expansion plan on branches?” Till financial year '19 for the previous years, we had about\\n\\nincremental branches of 50 per year. Our chairman said we had only two branches got opened\\n\\nin the last year. So, this year we are waiting and watching. We will be firming up how much of\\n\\nbranch we will be opening in the fourth quarter and all. We also need to take into account how\\n\\nthe third wave if at all any going to be there. So we will take appropriate call looking into the\\n\\nenvironment on step-by-step basis. And Mr. Mani Sundaram also asked about “What are all\\n\\nthe necessary steps the Bank had taken to take care of the staffs on COVID.?” Chairman\\n\\nexplained in detail what are all the steps we have taken. In fact, we worked closely with the\\n\\ngovernment and arranged for vaccination and all. We also explained to you that 99% of the\\n\\nstaff members who are eligible have already been vaccinated and things like that. During the\\n\\nlockdown period, we had enabled working from home, reduced man hours, working in shifts\\n\\nand also taking the COVID vaccination. The chairman also outlined in his speech. So, thanks\\n\\nfor   your   concern   for   our   employees   particularly   on   this   front.   We   took   whatever   in   our\\n\\ncapacity to take care of these things.\\n\\nWe   had   Mr.   Abhishek   who   is   also   a   lawyer.   He   also   congratulated   the   Bank   on   the\\n\\nperformance, dividend, the profit and multiple things. He also asked about “What are all the\\n\\nplans the Bank has for the COVID and all?” I explained, we are keeping a close watch on that.\\n\\nHe   also   asked,   “Any   salary   cut   or   sacking   of   employees   and   all?”   No.   It   will   be   totally\\n\\ninhuman   to  talk   about   the  salary   cut   or   sacking  and  all,   particularly   during  the   period   of\\n\\npandemic, particularly the employees who are with us in a dedicated passion for so many years\\n\\nand all and who plan to have their careers with us and all. Banking being a service industry\\n\\nparticularly when the employees need to have a direct contact with the staff members, those\\n\\noptions may be discussed only when it becomes absolutely necessary, by god's grace, things\\n\\ndid not happen so that. In fact, chairman also explained how we took care of even contract\\n\\nemployees and watchmen and all when government allowed CSR funds can be utilized for\\n\\ngiving some COVID-related incentives to them. We also used about Rs.90 lakhs to Rs.1 crore\\n\\nfor that particular thing. So, we did not think of any salary cuts or sacking. Even though there\\n\\nwas a shot in the financial year '19-20, we were able to show increased growth and also the\\n\\nPage 15 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nprofitability even better than what we originally thought during the year beginning. So we did\\n\\nnot consider any salary cuts or sacking or whatever it is.\\n\\nOn  “cost  cutting  front?”  we   have  tried  various  efforts.   Wherever  the   efficiency  is  needed\\n\\nparticularly including things like the rent, using the productivity of technology and all, we\\n\\nhave been doing that and some amount of benefit we were able to see that on that front.\\n\\nHe has asked about “How the financial year '21-22 will be and particularly on moratorium\\n\\nwhat was given in the last year and all?” The things have definitely improved in the current\\n\\nyear despite we had the COVID second wave. We hope the COVID third wave should not be\\n\\nthere,   we   pray   for  that.   And   even  if   there  is   a   COVID  wave,   we   believe   because   of   the\\n\\nvaccination and other things, the impact will be much lower and all, I think we should be able\\n\\nto have a reasonably good financial year '21-22 in all parameters including growth, slippages\\n\\nand all. The transcript and all are available in our website which we are continuously doing\\n\\nwhich will also help you to have an idea of what we are thinking basically on a continuous\\n\\nbasis.\\n\\nAnd he also suggested “Interactions with the global investors and all should go.” Yes, we are\\n\\non a continuous discussion. Earlier and all, we used to go in person. Now the virtual meetings\\n\\nhave enabled us to have discussions with more and more number of the global investors. So we\\n\\nare   doing   that   and   we   are   able   to   keep   a   constant   communication   open   with   the   global\\n\\ninvestors and also domestic investors by and large.\\n\\nAnd he has asked, “What are all the things we have made to reduce the legal and audit fees and\\n\\nall?”  We  are continuously  evaluating  that  in  the coming  days,  we feel  we  are reasonably\\n\\nmanaging them. There are also a trade-off. So we cannot compromise on the quality also.\\n\\nWhen you need quality, some amount of extra premium you have to give. We take all those\\n\\nthings into account. And we hope when we are compared with the peers and other Banks in the\\n\\nindustry, we are keeping at track on that and ensure that no unnecessary flab is there.\\n\\nAnd thanks for offering your empanelment. If needed, we will definitely get in touch with you.\\n\\nMr. Abhishek asked, “Which year AGM and all?” See, Kumbakonam Bank which was started\\n\\nin the year 1904. Then there were amalgamation of four Banks including one City Forward\\n\\nBank,   one  Union  Bank  and  also  one   Bank  called,   Commonwealth  Bank  who's  assets  and\\n\\nliabilities were taken somewhere in the mid-50s. And in, initial portion the Companies Act of\\n\\n1881 or 1882 required in those years there were no annual general meeting but they were\\n\\nconducted once in two years and things like that. So, that's why we always mentioned the year\\n\\nin which the annual general meeting is there. And since we had multiple Banks which got\\n\\namalgamated, as a practice, we are giving only the annual general meeting year and not 115 th\\n\\nmeeting or 116th  meeting, like that we don't give because right from the beginning, this has\\n\\nbeen the practice of our Bank.\\n\\nPage 16 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nWe had Mr. G. Sankaran who spoke at length about “The impact of COVID particularly on the\\n\\nimpact on the Banking industry, how it has reduced the capacity to lend and also the sight of\\n\\nrepayment, the mounting NPAs and all problems during the pandemic year and all?” And also,\\n\\n“Despite being in the pandemic year, he acknowledged the Bank has given its performance to\\n\\nthe best” Thank you, Mr. Sankaran for your wishes. Particularly being a retired chief manager\\n\\nof the Bank, it means a lot to us and all current employees feel inspired by your wishes as\\n\\nWe had Then Mr. Santosh Kumar Saraf. “He offered condolences to our CUBians who passed\\n\\nalways.\\n\\naway during the COVID.”\\n\\n“He thanked for the Dividend.”\\n\\n“He also congratulated for the CASA increase of 27%.”\\n\\nHe also wanted to look into “What is the savings Bank balance?” Savings Bank balance on\\n\\n31st, March was Rs.9,228 crores.\\n\\nHe also asked about “The steps taken for the employees during the COVID.”\\n\\nAnd also, “He suggested not to allow people without vaccination into the branches and all.”\\n\\nAs told by the chairman, over 99% of our people had their vaccination, and some of them are\\n\\nwaiting for the second vaccination and all. Particularly, we thank the governments both the\\n\\nstate government and central government and particularly the government of Tamil Nadu for\\n\\nhelping us to get all of our team members vaccinated.\\n\\nI also earlier spoke about the other facilities like work-from-home. We currently don't have\\n\\nanybody working from home; everybody has started attending the office.\\n\\nAnd he also spoke about “Many of the important green initiatives like rainwater harvesting,\\n\\nrenewable energy for which what are all the steps we have taken?”\\n\\n“What are all the steps we have taken for not to use the single use plastics and all?”\\n\\nI have to thank him for bringing this important point, particularly when people talk about the\\n\\nglobal warming, very important things for the sustainability and we should aspire to live in a\\n\\nbetter planet for next generations. At all our own premises, we have our rainwater harvesting\\n\\nthing. Wherever we are in rented premises, and where the premises where we don't have direct\\n\\ncontrol, we are not in a position to do anything on that front, but we take it very seriously and\\n\\nall our own premises, where we have the entire building, the rainwater harvesting has been\\n\\nundertaken.   In   fact,   it   became   a   law   almost   10-years   back   every   building   should   have\\n\\nrainwater harvesting and all. We are fully in compliance with that.\\n\\nPage 17 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nOn renewable energy, we started making our own attempts a few years back. We had got\\n\\nhandful of branches, where we went for solar panels. So, we encountered certain technical\\n\\nissues. That was our plan to go for solar panels wherever it is possible, but there are certain\\n\\nissues on that. At the same time, we are planning to have our panels with the solar roof on a\\n\\nnew proposed building which is expected to come up in Guindy, Chennai. So we are very\\n\\nserious about it and we are taking steps and doing everything which is under our control.\\n\\nAnd we happily lend for the renewable energy sources like both solar and wind. Though both\\n\\nthe segments are doing reasonably well and all, when the windmill started in a big way about a\\n\\ndecade back we had a good portfolio on that. And we did not have much NPA from that\\n\\nsegment also. Similarly, after the solar started coming, we are very active in that particular\\n\\nsegment which I want to inform you at this particular point of time. And thanks for all the\\n\\nwishes.\\n\\nMr. Saraf also spoke about “Whether we can have over AGM through virtual mode and all.”\\n\\nLet's see how things pan out. Depending upon the instructions from the regulator and the\\n\\ngovernment and also how things move forward, we keep your point in in our mind and we will\\n\\ndo the best job possible on this particular agenda.\\n\\nWe had finally Mr. K.S. Balasubramaniam who congratulated the Bank for a reasonably good\\n\\n2021 and all business growth in all parameters. And also he wishes for CSR spending in water\\n\\ntank desilting, providing oxygen concentrator and all the things he congratulated us Thank you\\n\\nvery much, sir.\\n\\nexplain.\\n\\nAnd also, for the technology initiatives, he appreciated.\\n\\nHe asked the “Cost of deposits and the yield on advances have come down.” He asked us to\\n\\nBasically, it happens in tune with the interest rate cycle. As you all know the central Bank and\\n\\nparticularly   directed   by   the   monetary   policy   committee,   they   tried   to   have   a   hold   on   the\\n\\ninterest rate cycle. So, in the interest rate, is moved upward or downward and handled by\\n\\nvarious instruments by the monetary policy committee to ensure that on the mandate available\\n\\nto  the  Bank  to  take  care  of  the  inflation  to  support   the  growth,   all  such  things  they  take\\n\\ndecisions on moving the interest rate up or down. Depending upon that the market interest rate,\\n\\nliquidity and all will change which is a market-driven parameter. So, we are into a decreasing\\n\\ninterest rate scenario, looks like finally, it is getting stabilized. When the interest rate cycle\\n\\ncomes down, automatically both the deposits rates and also yields will come down, and there\\n\\nwill be surplus liquidity in the market. Because of the lower cost, once again, the economy will\\n\\nstart picking up. That is the way with which things are managed. So, we have to just follow\\n\\nwhat is happening and align our market rate in tune with the market rates both on cost of\\n\\ndeposits and yield on advances front.\\n\\nPage 18 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nMr.   Balasubramaniam   also   asked,   why   are   we   going   for   equity   infusion.   And   he   also\\n\\nacknowledges this is only an enabling resolution.\\n\\nOnce again we need this enabling resolution because whenever we have right opportunity or\\n\\nwe need not waste time in other paperwork and all. Any permission by the shareholders, the\\n\\napproval will be valid for one full year. That's why we have been taking your permission for\\n\\nthe last seven, eight years. It is almost for the last six, seven years we have not utilized that, we\\n\\nwill use it when it is absolutely necessary.\\n\\nAnd he asked “Whether the adequate provisions have been made?” Yes, all the provisions\\n\\nhave been made as per the regulatory norms and as per the auditors’ requirement and all.\\n\\nAnd   he   asked   “About   the   provision   coverage   ratio.”   As   we   have   disclosed   the   current\\n\\nprovision   coverage   ratio,   including   the   technical   written   off   accounts   as   per   the   RBI\\n\\nguidelines, is currently about 63.57 percentage. The annual slippage ratio to closing advances\\n\\nfor the last five years is already given. In fact, we shared with the investors and it is also on our\\n\\nwebsite during our conference calls with the investors along with our fourth quarter results, we\\n\\nmay be having almost equal to whatever we had last year, but we feel the things should get\\n\\nbetter and we are doing our best to have everything under control.\\n\\nHe also spoke about RBI penalty on agri loan, MSME. And he also mentioned that the penalty\\n\\namount is not important, it's an indication on the lapse on the management. Sir, the point is\\n\\nwell taken, we are doing our best to keep us as one of the compliant Banks complying with the\\n\\nall regulatory prescriptions and the law of the land. So this is one exception, which happened\\n\\nwhich were beyond our control. We take your point and we will do our best to ensure that such\\n\\nan embarrassing situation will not come in future. We are doing our best to do that. I want to\\n\\nrecord it at this particular point.\\n\\nSo he also congratulated the management on the overall performance. So, I think we have\\n\\ndiscussed about the points almost raised by all the shareholders. I once again thank every\\n\\nshareholder for that.\\n\\nMr. Padmanabhan since he couldn't join because of the technical problem, he has given about\\n\\nfour,   five   questions,   which   I   probably   will   answer.   “What   is   your   dividend   policy?”   So,\\n\\nbasically, there are regulatory prescriptions on how much portion of the net  profit can be\\n\\nshared with the shareholders as a dividend. That is the broader prescription. We don't have any\\n\\nchoice. We have to be in full compliance with that regulatory prescription. Apart from that, we\\n\\nalso continuously make at track, we ensure what is going to be the future growth rate. The\\n\\npoint is, as I explained earlier, Banks will have growth on a continuous basis and it will always\\n\\nrequire growth capital. Even the first speaker, Mr. Bhesania told, if you give more dividend,\\n\\nonce again you have to collect it back as a share capital because the capital requirement will be\\n\\non a continuous basis. So, we take into account all the future capital requirements and take a\\n\\ncall both in terms for the growth and also for the other requirement over and above the basic\\n\\nregulatory  prescription  whatever that   is available,   we take  a  call  on  that.   To answer  your\\n\\nPage 19 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nquestion  straight,   it  is  determined  by the  regulatory prescription on  the  cap  which can be\\n\\nshared as the dividend.\\n\\n“Why   the   market   prices   of   our   company   gone   down   below   Rs.150   recently?”   This   is\\n\\nsomething which we don't have any control. We can only do our duty like what Lord Krishna\\n\\ngave it in the Bhagavad Gita, “Karmanye Vadhikaraste, Ma Phaleshou Kada Chana” So, our\\n\\njob is to do our duty, we are doing everything possible in our control to improve the business,\\n\\nkeep everything in the most efficient manner, to have the efficiency and profitability ratios\\n\\nclose to the best and all. So, to the market you fit, basically it has a lead or lag effect and other\\n\\ndemand   and   supply   and   so   many   general   perceptions.   So,   I   can   only   say   that   on   the\\n\\nperformances front, we are doing our best. Even in performance also, some of the things are\\n\\nbeyond our control, but whatever it is, we are doing our best to do a best job. When I joined\\n\\nthe Bank way back in 2003 over the last 18 years, earlier the market used to give us the price-\\n\\nto-book value multiple of only 0.5. So, currently, the price-to-book value is close to about two.\\n\\nThat expansion has happened over a period of time. And the market has taken its time and\\n\\nrewarded the Bank. What we do is that we do our best possible in terms of the performance\\n\\nand then leave it to god which means the market is god. The market will decide and we hope\\n\\nthe market will reward it at appropriate juncture.\\n\\n“Why   gross   and   net   NPA   is   going   up?”   So   for   this   particular   year,   it   is   because   of   the\\n\\npandemic, you had a lockdown for many months. It's the industry phenomenon. On slippage\\n\\nfront, showing some amount of upward and recovery is also not happening to the phase who\\n\\nwould like to see because the courts and all were also shut down. And now only things are\\n\\ngetting slowly back to the normal. So we hope things will start improving from the financial\\n\\nyear '22-23. Once the court procedures improve, the recoveries will improve. We are also\\n\\nreaching towards the end of the bad impact by COVID pandemic. So we hope the incremental\\n\\nslippage ratio in the second half will come down assuming that there won't be any third wave\\n\\nof COVID. So, things should stabilize and improve from whatever we have currently.\\n\\n“What are all the steps taken to improve your business and net profit and all? As I told you,\\n\\ntaking care of the existing customers, we are trying to improve our efficiency in each and\\n\\nevery line item on a continuous basis. So, the growth also needs to pick up because we had\\n\\nalmost one and a half, two year period of lull growth and all. So, we are now taking care of\\n\\neverything and also taking steps to improve the NPA recovery through various means. So,\\n\\nonce the growth starts and also the slippages stabilizes and recovery improve, all parameters\\n\\notherwise the track will come back to the normalcy. So, I request all the shareholders… this is\\n\\none request I normally used to place in the AGM to include the welfare of the employees in\\n\\nyour morning prayers, it is very much required on taking things forward.\\n\\nAnd with this, I think I have answered the questions that were discussed by the shareholders\\n\\nand also one e-mail from Mr. Padmanabhan who had registered earlier but could not join. So,\\n\\nwith this a few words, I once again thank all the shareholders for the affection and ownership,\\n\\nwhich   you   show   on   us.   I   trust   this   affection   will   continue.   Your   wishes   and   prayer   will\\n\\nPage 20 of 22\\n\\n\\x0cdefinitely take the Bank from strength-to-strength and improve all the parameters in that way\\n\\nthe shareholders wealth also. Thank all of you to participate in this AGM.\\n\\nShri R. Mohan:\\n\\nI hope you are happy with our M.D. and CEO for his response. I thank our M.D. and CEO for\\n\\nhis replies.\\n\\nCity Union Bank Limited\\nAugust 19, 2021\\n\\nK. Vaidyanathan:\\n\\nGood afternoon.
