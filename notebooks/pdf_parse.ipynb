Namaskaar<mask>and Hearty Welcome to all of you ! I hope all of you and your family members are keeping fine !!<mask>At the outset, let me thank you all for your presence, continued support and faith reposed in the Bank and its Management.<mask>As you may appreciate, this is an important annual event for the Bank where it engages itself with its shareholders and where<mask>they are going to vote on our resolutions set out in Notice calling this meeting. However, in view of the statutory directions<mask>issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and Securities and Exchange Board of India in the wake of COVID Pandemic<mask>we are holding the Annual General Meeting this year also in the virtual mode. The Bank has provided the Annual Report<mask>together   with   the   Notice   of   the   Annual   General   Meeting   for   the   year   ended   31 st  March,   2021   in   electronic   mode   to<mask>shareholders. With your kind permission, I shall consider it as read.<mask>Being an e-AGM, considering technical factors / restrictions on participation, I would like to be brief in my speech giving<mask>more focus on the financial performance of the Bank for FY 2021 and our Banks continued efforts in overcoming the impact<mask>of the pandemic.<mask>GLOBAL ECONOMY<mask>The global economy witnessed an unprecedented downturn in FY 2020-21 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Central banks<mask>across the Globe provided liquidity support along with various credit extension policies to a wide range of borrowers. These<mask>measures increased the momentum of economic activity in the latter part of the year. The IMF (International Monetary<mask>Fund) predicted in its April 2021 World Economic Outlook that the global economy is projected to grow at 6.0 per cent in<mask>the calendar year 2021. Since April 2021, the global economic recovery has been gaining momentum, driven mainly by<mask>major advanced economies and massive vaccination drives and stimulus packages. Inflation in major Emerging Market<mask>Economies (EME’s) has risen above the official targets, due to sustained rise in food and commodity prices. The World<mask>Trade Organization has projected an expansion of 8% in Global Merchandise Trade although they will remain below the pre-<mask>pandemic level. Cross-border services such as tourism and transportation are likely to remain subdued till the time the<mask>pandemic recedes globally, and restrictions on international travel ease resuming confidence of the passengers. A collective<mask>global effort to fight the pandemic will bring better results, than individual countries fighting alone & the G20 countries’<mask>goal of a strong, sustainable and inclusive growth is within sight and reach. <mask>Page 3 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>INDIAN ECONOMY   <mask>In India, the second wave of the pandemic has taken a serious toll both in terms of lives and livelihood of many. The<mask>recovery that had commenced in the latter half of FY 2020-21 was halted by the second wave of the pandemic that surfaced<mask>in April-May 2021. The efforts of the RBI and Government in financial inclusion have helped the State machinery in<mask>providing seamless and timely financial support to weaker sections of the society through direct benefit transfers (DBT).<mask>The Manufacturing sector & Mining sector suffered the worst with huge losses in Q1. <mask>The pharmaceuticals sector for the obvious reasons, witnessed a boom aided by the production-linked incentive scheme<mask>(PLI) introduced for bulk drugs and medical devices, which augmented the domestic pharmaceutical production and medical<mask>exports. The services sector suffered heavily in the initial period and so also the contact intensive sectors such as aviation,<mask>tourism, and hospitality. The IT sector displayed resilience amidst the pandemic. FASTags, the facility of cashless tolling<mask>which was made mandatory in February 2021 resulted in strong growth of National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC). E-<mask>commerce platform witnessed robust growth with rising waves of digitization. <mask>With Covid-19 second showing signs of decline  in  early  June  21,  and  the  likely  availability  of  sufficient  vaccines by<mask>September 2021, growth in second half of FY21-22 is likely to pick up which would trigger positive outcomes for the Indian<mask>economy. <mask>BANKING SCENARIO <mask>To   mitigate   the   financial   impact  of  Covid-19  related   disruptions,   the   Reserve   Bank   of   India   undertook   several   policy<mask>measures  to  ease  the  flow  of  credit  at  a  lower  cost  to  needy  segments.   These  measures  include  lowering  policy  rate,<mask>launching on-tap liquidity schemes and channelizing liquidity through All India Financial Institutions to resolve stressed<mask>loans to individuals, small businesses and MSME borrowers. Further, with an objective to provide more focus on inclusive<mask>development, the RBI broadened the scope of PSL (Priority Sector Lending). <mask>The Reserve Bank of India continued with its accommodative stance and undertook several measures to arrest the downturn<mask>in domestic economic  activity,  to ease  financial  conditions  and  the  functioning of financial markets  while  maintaining<mask>financial stability and the soundness of payment and settlement systems. <mask>The Reserve Bank of India on the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situations, made the<mask>following changes at its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting held on August 06, 2021: <mask>\\uf0d8 Policy repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) unchanged 4.0 per cent. <mask>\\uf0d8 Reverse repo ratio under Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) was maintained at 3.35 percent. <mask>\\uf0d8 Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate maintained at 4.25 per cent.<mask>The health of the Banking Sector emerged as top most priority for the Reserve Bank of India as it sought to provide more<mask>cushion to the sector already ravaged by the pandemic. The timely measures of RBI have infused a sense of optimism<mask>amongst banks. Containing measures like lockdown and stoppage of transportation, which paralyzed the business enterprises<mask>had their impact on banks in terms of loan recoveries.  As said earlier plethora of steps taken by RBI and Government of<mask>Page 4 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>India  like Resolution  Plan,   ECLGS (Emergency Credit  link Guarantee Scheme)  etc.,  would  help both  banks  and their<mask>borrowers to overcome the damage caused by the pandemic. These measures along with vaccination drives and a collective<mask>effort at the global level to arrest the pandemic are all expected to propel the global economy out of woods in the year ahead.<mask>OUR BANK’S RESPONSE <mask>With the threat of the third wave of the pandemic looming large, the Bank continues to remain cautious. Safety measures like<mask>alternative work arrangements, creation of awareness among employees, fully sanitizing the environment, providing health<mask>camps for employees and their families, reducing in-person interactions, redesigning working hours through implementation<mask>of shift system etc., are taken. During the year our Bank conducted vaccination programmes at several centres including our<mask>Administrative Office covering 4663 employees constituting 99% of total eligible workforce. A high level committee by<mask>name “Quick Response Team” was also formed as directed by RBI to oversee the entire developments in the context of the<mask>spread of COVID 19.<mask>Coming to the credit side, in line with the policies of RBI & Central Government, the Bank has provided credit to MSME<mask>sector under Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) at a concessional rate to help them tide over the economic<mask>distress. The Quantum of relief provided under ECLGS is Rs. 1,960 crore covering 8,556 borrowers’ upto March 31, 2021.<mask>The   relief   provided   to   borrowers   on   repayment   of   their   loan-dues   particularly   interest   burden,   pursuant   to   regulatory<mask>directions, is a timely help to them to cope with the pressure on their strained cash flows. <mask>We always extend our support and services to all our customers improvising our products and operational efficiency using<mask>the updated technology. At the same time we ensure that our hoary tradition well established by the founders of the Bank is<mask>maintained with no compromise on the core values. <mask>MOVING TO PERFORMANCE OF YOUR BANK<mask>In the current market scenario which is largely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, your Bank recorded a reasonable growth<mask>rate during the year in comparison to previous year. In the reporting year, the biggest challenge faced by the Banking system<mask>was dealing with mounting stressed assets, restructured debts and NPA accounts. Despite these challenges, the Bank was<mask>able to post an 8% growth in its total business, with Deposits growing by 9% and Gross Advances growing by 7%. The total<mask>business of the Bank as on 31st March, 2021 stood at Rs. 81,558 crore.<mask>The Net Interest Margin or NIM of your Bank stood at 4% for the year ended   March 31, 2021. CASA stood at 29% of<mask>Deposits which improved from 25% in the previous year. Credit Deposit Ratio has recorded 83% at the end of the year. As a<mask>result, the Net Interest Income rose from Rs. 1,676 to Rs. 1,830 crore registering a growth of 9%. Your Bank’s operating<mask>profit rose from Rs. 1,341 crore to Rs.1,484 crore. Net Profit rose from Rs. 476 crore to Rs. 593 crore. The return on assets<mask>improved to 1.15% from 1% last year. <mask>PROFITABILITY<mask>DEPOSITS <mask>Page 5 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>During the year, deposits have increased from Rs.40,832 crore to Rs.44,537 crore as on 31 st March 2021 recording a growth<mask>rate of 9%. The cost of deposit of the Bank decreased from 6.20% in FY 2020 to 5.36% in FY 2021.<mask>ADVANCES<mask>As for advances, the position increased from Rs. 34,576 crore as on 31st March 2020 to Rs.37,021 crore as on 31st March<mask>2021 registering a growth rate of 7%. The yield on advances decreased from 10.76% to 9.91% during the reporting year on<mask>account of the transmission of the cut in the key rates to the borrowers, as expected of us by the Regulator. The priority<mask>sector advances stood at Rs. 20,648 crore as at 31st March 2021 as compared to previous year amount of Rs. 17,507 crore<mask>and aggregated to 56% of the Bank’s adjusted net credit which is well above the regulatory prescription of 40%. <mask>NON PERFORMING ASSETS<mask>The Gross NPA increased from 4.09% to 5.11%. With the Covid restrictions hampering the legal proceedings we could not<mask>make much progress during the year in the recovery of bad loans. The Net NPA increased to 2.97% compared to 2.29% last<mask>year. As the standstill order was in vogue in the first 9 months, bank as a prudent measure made adhoc Covid provisions<mask>every quarter.   During Q4 FY21 we utilized a sum of Rs. 309 crore from and out of the same towards provision for bad<mask>debts. Thus a net adhoc Covid provision of Rs. 31 crore was made during the year taking the total adhoc Covid provision to<mask>Rs. 156 crore. <mask>INVESTMENTS / TREASURY OPERATIONS<mask>During the year under review gross investments has increased from Rs. 9,236 crore to Rs. 9,523 crore. The total Yield on<mask>investments worked out to 8.20%. In the midst of a stressed scenario, I must acknowledge here the redemptive role played<mask>by our Treasury department. During the reporting year the Bank has booked treasury profit to the tune of Rs. 233.41 crore as<mask>against Rs. 159.60 crore last year, a handsome increase of Rs. 74 crore, by effectively manoeuvring the volatile yield<mask>movements and timely sale of securities. Further, the Non-interest income of the Bank registered a 4% growth from Rs. 680<mask>crore to Rs. 705 crore mainly on account of increase in treasury income. <mask>NET OWNED FUNDS / CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIO   <mask>     <mask>The Bank's paid-up capital stood at Rs. 73.88 crore as on 31 st March, 2021. The Bank’s net worth increased from Rs. 5,253<mask>crore as on 31st March 2020 to Rs. 5,799 crore as on 31 st March 2021. The Capital Adequacy Ratio under BASEL III as at<mask>31st March, 2021 stood at 19.52% which is well above the stipulated regulatory norm. <mask>REWARDING SHAREHOLDERS <mask>BRANCHES<mask>Your Directors declared an interim dividend of 30% on the equity shares for the financial year 2020-21 during the month of<mask>May 2021 itself, in pursuance of its constant philosophy of rewarding shareholders. In addition, your Directors have also<mask>recommended final dividend of 20% for FY 2020-21 in line with the extant directions issued by RBI on Dividend issue.    <mask>Page 6 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>During the financial year because of the pandemic, the Bank could expand its branch network by adding only two more<mask>branches totalling 702 branches and 1,724 ATM’s as on 31st March, 2021.<mask>TECHNOLOGY<mask>The Covid 19 pandemic has accelerated the push towards digitalization with greater adoption of digital payments. Keeping<mask>in mind the Covid protocols the Bank swiftly introduced “ CUB EASY” a video KYC based account opening Application in<mask>the year 2020, which has garnered tremendous response.<mask>The evolution and adoption of newer technology has led to a significant improvement in deepening the digital transmission<mask>services. During the year, “Device Binding” in Mobile banking app was introduced as an enhanced security measure to<mask>customers whereby mobile banking app can be accessed only from the registered mobile device. Today, Payment System has<mask>assumed great importance and it is considered as the lifeline of Digital Banking and in tune with the trend improvisation<mask>takes place at our end also. Our “CUB All in One App” is now fully integrated with Unified Payment Interface (UPI) & Scan<mask>and pay functionalities. Even Non-CUB customers can use this application for payment purposes.<mask> <mask>Investment options have been introduced in Net/Mobile Banking whereby customers can make investments in Sovereign<mask>Gold Bonds, Mutual Funds, IPO / Rights Application through ASBA etc. Our Bank has introduced Interoperable Card Less<mask>Cash Withdrawal (ICCW) from ATM using UPI in our NCR ATMs whereby customers can withdraw from the ATM<mask>without   using   Debit   cards.   Moreover   during   the   Covid   19   pandemic   and  lockdown,   some   of   our   staff   members   were<mask>compelled to work from Home. The Bank provided them with secured VPN (Virtual Private Network) connectivity with<mask>installation of Antivirus and Patch management solutions. <mask>RISK MANAGEMENT<mask>The Bank has in place, a sound Risk Management Architecture, established by the active involvement and supervision of<mask>Board of Directors. The Board of the Bank has constituted a Risk Management Committee, which assesses the Bank’s risk<mask>profile and key areas of risk in particular. Under the supervision of the Risk Management Committee of the Directors, the<mask>Risk   Management   Committee  of   Executives  functions  to   ensure  that   the  policy   guidelines   approved  by   the  Board   are<mask>implemented and faithfully adhered to.<mask>The Bank has a Risk Management team headed by the Chief Risk Officer, who reports directly to MD & CEO/ Risk<mask>Management Committee (RMC) of the Board. The overall risks faced by the Bank and the risk appetite are evaluated by the<mask>Risk Management Department which frames policies and procedures, verifying the models that are used for pricing products,<mask>identifying new risks etc. Risk Management practices have been aligned with the best industry practices and are adaptable to<mask>the dynamic operating environment and market conditions.<mask>The Bank is BASEL II compliant since 31 st March, 2009. The Bank has implemented the BASEL III Capital Regulations<mask>from 1st April, 2013, by computing the Capital and Risk weighted Assets as per RBI guidelines dated 2 nd May, 2012. The<mask>Bank presently adopts Standardized Approach for Credit Risk, Standardized Duration Approach for Market Risk and Basic<mask>Indicator Approach for Operational Risk. Necessary initiatives have been taken for moving over to advanced approaches<mask>under BASEL III as per the timelines indicated by RBI. The Risk Management Department of the Bank effectively functions<mask>to measure, monitor and control all risks paving way for effective Enterprise-wide Risk Management. <mask>Page 7 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY<mask>Coming to our commitment to the society I must say that CSR has always remained an integral part of the Bank.<mask>The Bank’s CSR wing “Cub Foundation” is continuing to play a vital role in supporting the community in the vital areas like<mask>Swatch Bharat, Health care, Literacy, Rural sports, Community Development & Environment sustainability particularly<mask>water  resource  management etc.   In the  year under  report,  we   have spent   a  total  sum  of Rs.10.95  crore towards  these<mask>activities.<mask> <mask>During the year, we prioritized our outgoes under CSR towards containing the spread of Covid 19. We provided Covid<mask>Relief Fund to the various municipalities and Government bodies to the extent of Rs.125 lacs. As allowed by a Circular from<mask>the Ministry of Corporate Affairs stating that any exgratia given to Temporary / Casual / Daily Wage Workers / Security<mask>Guards can be accommodated under CSR, we disbursed a sum of Rs.93 lacs to such workers in our Bank. In the current<mask>year, at the onslaught of the second wave of the pandemic, we spent a sum of Rs.3.25 crore towards supply of Oxygen<mask>concentrators to various hospitals and towards Chief Ministers Relief Fund. <mask>As in the past, the Bank has continued its contribution towards conservation of Water bodies, & conservation of rainwater<mask>for groundwater recharge. The project on recharge of groundwater focused on desiltation of older ponds for collection of<mask>water. This was conducted at various districts in Tamilnadu which also covered cleaning and deepening of various lakes and<mask>rivers particularly in Kumbakonam, to augment ground water levels and conserve water for agricultural purposes. <mask>HUMAN RESOURCE<mask>As on 31st March, 2021, the Bank had on its roll 5,843 employees including 50 Executives. The Human Resource function<mask>continued to build & provide a cordial and safe work atmosphere to all employees by implementing the Covid guidelines<mask>issued by Union Health Ministry and State Government on the staff strength at workplace. The commitment and grit shown<mask>by our employees during the testing times has been exemplary. <mask>It also needs a mention here that during the reporting year, the management of the Bank considering the risks and efforts<mask>made by all employees during hard & continuing phases of COVID pandemic, has granted COVID incentive in monetary<mask>terms to all employees of the Bank. <mask>When I acknowledge the sincere services of our employees during the pandemic times, I feel pained to mention that the bank<mask>lost six of our Cubians on account of this terrible Covid. I pay my sincere homage to them. <mask>In the context of COVID 19, considering the need to adhere to safety norms & to continue the professional development of<mask>its   employees,   the   Bank   has   developed   an   e-learning   Management   System   (LMS).   LMS   is   a  software   application   for<mask>administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of educational courses / training programmes. It facilitates<mask>online learning process at users’ convenience. Initially an audio video lecture series on various fundamental aspects of credit<mask>was presented by the MD & CEO of the Bank. This has been made available to all staff members. Audio programmes on<mask>various other topics on banking are underway.   <mask>Page 8 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>Further,   during   the   reporting   year,   the   management   of   the   Bank   has   entered   into   pay   settlements   with   CUB   Officers<mask>Association (CUBOA) and CUB Staff Union (CUBSU) containing various monetary & non-monetary benefits. In fact the<mask>settlement which is due in September 2021, was advanced and made effective from 01 st  January 2021. Further, the pay<mask>structure of all Executives was also revised w.e.f. January 2021.      <mask>I take pride in expressing the fact that our employees always stand committed to win the  trust and confidence of our<mask>customers by their courteous service. The tireless efforts of our CUBians under the challenging conditions are truly laudable.<mask>The Bank has maintained a healthy work environment right from its inception and it needs to be mentioned here that there<mask>are no instances of industrial unrest till date.<mask>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<mask>Before   I   conclude,   I   hereby   extend   my   sincere   gratitude   to   the   Reserve   Bank   of   India,   all   Govt.   bodies,   Regulatory<mask>authorities,   Shareholders,   Customers,   business   associates,   my   colleagues   on   the   Board   of   the   Bank,   Executives   and<mask>Employees of the Bank for their continued support, guidance and patronage extended to the Bank in its growth process. My<mask>sincere appreciations to both Employees Union and Officers Association for their role in ensuring a harmonious Industrial<mask>relationship.<mask>With the grace of Almighty and with all your support, I am confident that our 116 years old organisation will continue to<mask>progress with added vigor touching new horizons of growth and glory in the years to come.<mask>I hope and pray that the world emerges victorious in its undaunted fight against the pandemic very soon. <mask>My best wishes to you all once again.<mask>Moderator:<mask>Thank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer session. We will wait for a<mask>moment while the question can be assembled.<mask>Moderator:<mask>I now invite Mr. Aspi Bhesania CLID 1201250000023508.<mask>Aspi Bhesania:<mask>Chairman Sir, I'm from Bombay. Sir Resolution No.8 is the QIP of Rs.500 crores, I request<mask>you to come with the rights issue rather than a QIP. The dividend of 50 paisa, that is 50%, I<mask>would like to know whether you prefer YES Bank model where to give high dividend and QIP<mask>regularly and one fine day everybody knows what happened. Another model is the Kotak Bank<mask>which gives less than one rupee dividend on Rs.1,700 share price. Rarely does a QIP and grow<mask>with its own funds. Pages 4 of annual report, in each of the five years, deposits are more than<mask>advances. If more deposits are coming, reduce the interest rate. Deposit grew by 9% where the<mask>advances grew by 7%. During the year Rs.41.7 lakhs of dividend and 14,709 shares were<mask>transferred   to   IEPF.   It's   the   shareholders   money.   You   should   try   to   identify   the   genuine<mask>shareholder. Even if you have to send someone from the nearest branch on 28th September<mask>next month Rs.64 lakhs will be transferred to IEPF. In one month do something to reduce this<mask>amount. Government is not doing anything with the shareholders money. So, 1.5 crore shares<mask>are still held in physical. What are your plans to eliminate physical shares? I also have only<mask>two   shares   in   physical   and   it's   not   worthwhile   demating   two   shares.   During   the   year,<mask>Page 9 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>provisions were Rs.891 crore and net profit was Rs.523 crores. Provisions are more than net<mask>profit by Rs.300 crores. NPA will destroy the  economy and economy is not likely to grow in<mask>the current year, although our government expects 8% growth. RBI imposes a penalty of Rs.1<mask>crore   on   discrepancies   detected   towards   soil   notes   remittance.   Who   will   levy   penalty   for<mask>discrepancies to RBI? Somebody has to make even RBI accountable. NIM of 4% is very good<mask>in a pandemic year. All three segments have done very well. I hope you will continue to do<mask>well in the future also. Our Q1 was also good for which I congratulate the entire management.<mask>Sir, I would like you to continue with virtual meeting even when physical AGM starts next<mask>year. Sir, thank you and all the best.<mask>Moderator:<mask>I now invite Mr. A.V. Mani Sundaram, CLID IN30163741521740.<mask>A.V. Mani Sundaram:<mask>I am Mani Sundaram. Welcome all the directors, Chairman and Company Secretary of City<mask>Union Bank. This year being a pandemic year, this year also you have given output maximum.<mask>My question is what is the NPA comparison for last year and this year ? Any recovery ? Give<mask>more dividend sir. Any expansion plan in ATMs and also branches ? Because money violation<mask>is very high due to this period of corona pandemic. I appreciate the services by your staff and<mask>colleagues. Thank you, sir. That's all.<mask>Moderator:<mask>I now invite Mr. J. Abhishek, CLID IN30163741359155.<mask>J Abhishek:<mask>I am Abhishek, shareholder of the company. My DP ID:IN30163741359155. Congratulations<mask>management on the eve of annual general body meeting.  Sir, I would like to know how is our<mask>Bank   impacted   in   these   past   two   years   of   COVID   time.   After   this   Corona   Virus   and<mask>subsequent lock down there is no industry untouched after the Covid so any employee have<mask>sacked, hired or any salary cut in percentage of any? And was there any salary cut was taken<mask>by the management within the pandemic period. What are the cost cutting initiatives that our<mask>Bank   has   taken?   What   is   the   view   of   the   management   going   forward   on   sustainable   and<mask>profitable growth remain challenging in the coming quarters? And RBI is keen on telling the<mask>Banks   to   provide   moratorium   and   certain   measures   they   also   provided.   So,   under   such<mask>circumstances, how do you see the net profits? I would request our management to kindly<mask>involve on like the concalls, quarterly presentations with the global investors on a regular basis<mask>which will increase the business to the Bank? What are the other expenses, legal charges and<mask>the audit fees? Myself and my team are running a legal firm in the name of in Chennai. I<mask>request yourself to kindly enroll our firm in the empanelment of the Bank and we will be glad<mask>to extend our services. I made a requested last year also but I have not received any revert back<mask>from our legal team. Since corona period was existing, I also did not made a presence on this.<mask>So I would request your goodself to include us in the empanelment. We are not able to see this<mask>year annual general body meeting be conducted now. It is more than 100 years I know that. in<mask>the notice also did not mention, in the banner also did not mention about this year annual<mask>general body meeting.<mask>Moderator:<mask>I now invite Mr. Padmanabhan.

I   have   lot   of   questions   to   ask   but   our   chairman   has   clarified   all   the<mask>City Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>questions. So, it is my duty to appreciate the Bank in this juncture. We hope that we will have<mask>a physical meet this year. But unfortunately the hide and seek game of COVID and we are still<mask>in the grip of COVID-19. So, globally, so many deaths and as our chairman pointed out we<mask>have   lost   six   staff   and   I   regret   very   much,   I   convey   my   deep   condolences   to   the   family<mask>members.   Because   of   this   COVID-19,   general   psychologically   and   mentally   affected   and<mask>frustration and fear of death. So, in turn, lack of interest and enthusiasm in purchasing except<mask>of day-to-day affairs essentials. So, the entire retail segment and related small scale industries<mask>and unorganic sector is much affected. So the people what they will do? They have to survive.<mask>Like   medical   bill   and   education   and   so   on   and   so   forth.   So   ultimately   they   will   simply<mask>postpone   the   repayment   of   the   Bank   loan.   It's   easy   for   them.   So   the   ultimate   sufferer   is<mask>Banking in this, in both ways; one, it is not able to lend further which is the prime activity of<mask>the Bank and because of no expansion of business and absence of new ventures. On the other<mask>side, the repayment is not forthcoming and more slippages and gross NPA increases. One Mrs.<mask>Jaya Vaidyanathan, recently I heard in Hindu, CFO in some organization. She said that NPA<mask>will zoom in the near future. Our Bank was very safe because we have not extended advances<mask>of big tickets. We used to talk every year in the AGM also.  Our concentration and more<mask>exposure   on   retailing   business   and   small   scale   industries   which   is   struggling   now   due   to<mask>pandemic. While this is a temporary phenomenon, last year also I have told, all the accounts,<mask>since I was working in this Bank, now retired staff, I know each and every account is backed<mask>by either immovable property of either business organization or the residential outs. So, it's a<mask>system-driven NPA.  Our Bank is fundamentally strong. Even in this bad scenario,  critical<mask>circumstances, we have done the best possible and I congratulate our M.D. and team of staff<mask>for their hard work that they are fundamentally strong. That is why I used to see mutual fund<mask>garner in the business organization. The mutual funds are accumulating our share. Their fund<mask>managers and business oriented. So they feel fundamentally strong and it is safe and they<mask>expect very good return in the long-term. That is why they are accumulating. We pray for the<mask>early recovery from this pandemic situation and definitely our Bank will outperform and give<mask>very good results in the coming years and I express my whole-hearted Onam greetings to<mask>Kerala brothers and sisters and customers. Thank you, sir for giving me the opportunity.<mask>our staff and employees, my name is Santosh Kumar Saraf. I am from Kolkata. First of all, my<mask>namaskar to you, sir. Hope all our directors, all our employees and all our shareholders who<mask>are attending today’s meeting are safe and in good health. I express my condolence to those<mask>employees who left us in the last year COVID time. I wish to god please give me om shanti,<mask>om shanti and help family make strong to fight and come out of this hard situation, sir. And sir,<mask>thanks management to announce very good dividend in line with RBI guideline. I hope that we<mask>will increase in the future sir. Also, I thank the management that last year our CASA deposit<mask>increased by 27% to Rs.12,981 crores. In this regard, I want to know how much amount in the<mask>savings account sir. Next sir, we have 5,040 employees. Hope all are vaccinated. If anyone not<mask>taken, what step are you taking? I request you to those who have not taken vaccine, please stop<mask>Page 11 of 22<mask>Moderator:<mask>I now invite Mr. Santosh Kumar Saraf.

Balasubramanian. CLID IN30115113526679.<mask>K.S. Balasubramanian:<mask>I congratulate the management for the satisfactory performance for the year 2021. All the<mask>City Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>them come to office and work. Because in Kerala, the situation is very bad. In India, 50%<mask>patients come from Kerala. I hope if they come without vaccine, the others will be affected. I<mask>request them to go to the private hospital with their families’ sir. Next I want to know what<mask>step you have taken for our building. In our building, is there rain water harvesting and use of<mask>its water and reduce fresh water consumption. Next sir, regarding renewable energy, I want to<mask>know what step you have taken? Are you installing solar panel on the roof or anywhere to<mask>become self-dependent in power supply sir? I want to know what steps have you taken in our<mask>offices to reduce use of single plastic because single use plastic is bad for our environment sir?<mask>How many percentage of our employees still work from home and what infrastructure facilities<mask>provided so they can work in coordination with each and other? Sir, lastly, I pray again for my<mask>chairman, all my directors, all my company staff, employees, customers for a healthy and safe<mask>life, happiness, wellness and prosperous 2021. Last I request you, sir, continue with video<mask>conference   meeting   so   I   can   attend   from   Kolkata,   somebody   can   attend   from   Bombay,<mask>somebody can attend from Salem. And also, our directors are attending from their homes. I<mask>wish and hope you will continue with this. If a physical meeting is held, not possible for video<mask>conference meeting. So I request you to please allot 15-20 minutes make a special session for<mask>pan India shareholders so they can express their views and wish for you long life, sir. Hope our<mask>Bank will improve in your leadership. Thank you sir for giving me time.<mask>economic parameters like 9% growth in deposits, 8% growth in to business, 7% increase in<mask>total asset, 9% growth in net interest income, 11% growth in gross profit, 25% growth in net<mask>profit, return on asset at 2.15%, return on equity at 10.73%, net interest margin at 4%, EPS at<mask>8.03, etc., all point to a fairly good performance amidst the impact of pandemic on the Indian<mask>economic activities. I also appreciate the need-based manner in which the CSR funds to the<mask>extent of Rs.10.95 crores have been spent during the year. Particular mention must be made<mask>about   desilting   of   many   tanks   in   Pachiyappan   area   in   Kumbakonam,   Thirukollikadu,<mask>Thirunagar, etc., on the picture shown in balance sheet before the work started and after the<mask>work was over underlines the effective use of the fund and besides the donation of oxygen<mask>concentrators to hospitals in Thanjavur, Pudukottai, Nagapattinam and various places. And<mask>also, the building community hall at Amar Seva Sangam in Tenkasi area and Swachh Bharat<mask>providing toilet facilities at public places and at various schools and stress on waste to energy<mask>is   a   special   mention.   Net   Banking   facilities,   artificial   intelligence   usage,   mobile   Banking,<mask>online   transfer   of   funds   and   digital   channels   are   quite   appreciable.   Sir,   while   the   cost   of<mask>deposits reduced to 5.36% from 6.2%, yield on advances declined to 9.91% from 10.76% due<mask>to the introduction of the ECLGS scheme with capping of 9.2% and gold loan at lower interest.<mask>Please   throw  more   light   on   this.   Segments   advances  as   per   guidelines  to   priority  section,<mask>agriculture, MSME sector and weaker sections and these sectors, the Bank should exercise<mask>more   caution.   The   capital   adequacy   ratio   is   much   more   than   the   RBI   Basel-III   norm<mask>stipulation. And our paid up capital is Rs.73.81 crores and net worth is Rs.5,799 crores. And<mask>there   is   a   deposit   growth   and   collection   efficiency   also   is   up   to   the   expectation.   In   the<mask>circumstances, why the Bank seeks the shareholders’ approval for issue of equity shares of<mask>Page 12 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>Rs.500 crores with the face value of Re.1 and at prevailing market rate to qualified institutional<mask>investors. Of course,  it is an enabling resolution, but still why should the  Bank go in for<mask>increasing the capital base? On gross NPA and net NPA, the provisioning made as at 31 st<mask>March   was   adequate   or   any   extra   provisioning   is   necessitated   by   this   time,   what   is   the<mask>provision coverage ratio at present? Operational efficiency and cost reduction should be the<mask>watch word hereafter. Any fresh slippages on the loan book, slippage into a closing advance<mask>percentage wise, restructured loan percentage wise, where it stands today. RBI has fined Bank<mask>of Rs.1 crore citing non-compliance on lending to agriculture sector, micro, small and medium<mask>enterprises, educational loans on account of waiver of margins and security requirements. It is<mask>not Rs.1 crore that matters, but certainly a lapse on the part of management. In spite of the<mask>corona effect and all these things, the Bank is doing very well and congratulations to all the<mask>staff for their excellent work because the Bank has about 6,000 staff as on date and they are all<mask>doing very well and I am a regular client of Sivananda Colony, Coimbatore branch and I am<mask>happy the customer service is excellent. So, I take this opportunity to record my sincere thanks<mask>to the management. Thanking you, sir.<mask>Moderator:<mask>That was the last question. I will now hand over to M.D. and CEO to proceed further.<mask>Dr. N. Kamakodi:<mask>Esteemed   shareholders   of   our   Bank,   chairman   and   colleagues   on   the   board   of   the   Bank,<mask>Statutory Auditors, Secretarial Auditors and each and every one of you participating in this e-<mask>AGM today, I convey my namaskaars to all of you for participating in this meeting.<mask>Answering the questions from the shareholders during the annual general body meeting had<mask>always been a pleasure for me. It in fact reinforces the amount of the affection. Each and every<mask>shareholders and every stakeholder is an asset of our Bank. And I take this opportunity to<mask>thank all the shareholders who have now come to express their opinion. And I would like to<mask>give my answers and explanations for all the questions possible as much as I could record<mask>during your discussions.<mask>So we had Mr. Bhesania who is first. He in fact made a point on regulations and particularly<mask>on the QIP resolution, “Why we are going for QIP, why not for the rights issue?” “And what is<mask>the model of the dividend which we are looking into basically compared with a couple of other<mask>Banks?” Basically, as we have told in the notice which is basically on enabling resolution. For<mask>the past six or seven years, every year we are getting your approval. But we use it only when it<mask>is absolutely necessary and also depending upon the opportunities available. Sometimes let's<mask>say for various reasons raising capital through QIP may be beneficial to the Bank. We will<mask>consider all the aspects and also take your view and also went through a couple of rights issue<mask>in the past. So we keep all the options open and take a call depending upon what is in the best<mask>interest of the Bank. Anyway, this is only an enabling resolution. We will use it only when it is<mask>absolutely necessary and also compare favorably with the other options. So, we are just taking<mask>it as an enabling resolution. It doesn't really mean that we will be utilizing it this year or not.<mask>We don't know. Let's say we keep all the paper works ready so that if at all it is needed, we<mask>may go for it. But it is only an enabling resolution.<mask>Page 13 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>Mr. Bhesania also spoke about the deposit growth is more than the advance growth rate. “Why<mask>don't you reduce the rate of interest for the deposits and all?” It's a very fine balance. Let's say<mask>our ALCO committee looks into this aspect on continuous basis. It is very difficult to align<mask>your deposit growth and advances growth in absolute harmony. So sometimes your deposit<mask>grows than the advance growth rate actually. Also, we have to take into consideration the<mask>general economic environment, interest rate cycle and all such things depending upon that we<mask>do. But whenever there is a decreasing interest rate cycle, our deposit rates also aligns with the<mask>overall interest rate cycle and you have seen the cost of deposits and funds also have come<mask>down in the last year which is our chairman also spoke during his address. At the same time,<mask>depositors will feel that like they are getting a raw deal. So we have to balance everything in<mask>tune with the market realities and the interest rate cycle. We will be taking a call, but your<mask>point is well taken and we will keep it for our future references. <mask>And Mr. Bhesania also added about “The fund is going to particularly the unclaimed dividend<mask>and all and also shares are getting transferred to the investor educational fund and all and it's<mask>the shareholders money which we have to take extra efforts and all?” Absolutely sir ! We are<mask>doing everything under our control to contact those shareholders. Sometimes, let's say the<mask>shareholders have moved away from their address on the record, there are various reasons<mask>which are beyond our control. Only when it is becoming absolutely not possible for us to<mask>identify   the   shareholder,   we   are   doing   everything   possible   including   going   for   the<mask>advertisements and contacting through various other options available and all, we are doing<mask>that. And it is getting transferred only when it is absolutely becoming impossible for us to trace<mask>them and give it to that. But your point is well taken on that.<mask>On eliminating the physical shares also, we are continuously taking all our efforts but as you<mask>yourself agreed, ultimately it becomes the choice of the shareholder, the cost which he feels<mask>whether it is worth or not and all. So, we are taking our efforts, but since it has become any<mask>transfer of securities, particularly through market sale and all, since it can happen only through<mask>the demat form, it is only matter of time before all physical shares getting converted into<mask>electronic format, but we are also taking all our efforts.<mask>You  also  spoke  about   the  provisioning.   Yes,   it  was  a  very  difficult  year.   We   had  a  total<mask>provision of Rs.865 crores for the financial year '19-20 which increased to Rs.891 crores for<mask>financial year '20-21, of which financial year '19-20, we had about Rs.631 crores for NPA and<mask>Rs.125 crores provision for COVID. This year we made about Rs.599 crores for the NPA and<mask>Rs.31 crores for infusion for COVID. As chairman also mentioned, since you had moratorium<mask>for first nine months and also during the COVID pandemic there were backlogs in the court<mask>procedures because courts and all were locked. So there is some slackness in terms of the<mask>recovery of the NPA which will get normalized as we proceed forward.<mask>And also, Mr. Saraf spoke about RBI penalty on cash deposits. And also congratulated on 4%<mask>net   interest   margin.   And   congratulated   for   performance   in   all   segments.   And   also<mask>congratulated for the first quarter performance. And also he expressed that to continue to the<mask>virtual AGM. So, we will take a call depending upon the instructions made available by the<mask>Page 14 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>both Department Of Company Affairs, SEBI and all. All the norms will be taken into account<mask>before taking a call. Anyway, we keep your suggestion on mind.<mask>Then, we had Mr. Mani Sundaram who gave comparison provisions which I just gave the<mask>numbers to you. And also, wanted us whether we can give more dividend and all. Banking is a<mask>business when the assets grow and the Bank grows, you need the continuous infusion of the<mask>capital particularly for both future growth and also for the future requirement. And there are<mask>also clear cut guideline from RBI metrics on how much dividend we are giving and all. We<mask>take into account particularly like what is the regulatory guideline and also the requirement of<mask>the future and all. Fortunately, since we had adequate capital even during the onset of the<mask>pandemic, when many Banks had to go for capital raising on urgent basis, we had a luxury of<mask>not diluting the capital particularly during this pandemic year. So we take all the contingencies<mask>into account and all the regulatory factors into account and we take a call on that.<mask>“Expansion plan on branches?” Till financial year '19 for the previous years, we had about<mask>incremental branches of 50 per year. Our chairman said we had only two branches got opened<mask>in the last year. So, this year we are waiting and watching. We will be firming up how much of<mask>branch we will be opening in the fourth quarter and all. We also need to take into account how<mask>the third wave if at all any going to be there. So we will take appropriate call looking into the<mask>environment on step-by-step basis. And Mr. Mani Sundaram also asked about “What are all<mask>the necessary steps the Bank had taken to take care of the staffs on COVID.?” Chairman<mask>explained in detail what are all the steps we have taken. In fact, we worked closely with the<mask>government and arranged for vaccination and all. We also explained to you that 99% of the<mask>staff members who are eligible have already been vaccinated and things like that. During the<mask>lockdown period, we had enabled working from home, reduced man hours, working in shifts<mask>and also taking the COVID vaccination. The chairman also outlined in his speech. So, thanks<mask>for   your   concern   for   our   employees   particularly   on   this   front.   We   took   whatever   in   our<mask>capacity to take care of these things.<mask>We   had   Mr.   Abhishek   who   is   also   a   lawyer.   He   also   congratulated   the   Bank   on   the<mask>performance, dividend, the profit and multiple things. He also asked about “What are all the<mask>plans the Bank has for the COVID and all?” I explained, we are keeping a close watch on that.<mask>He   also   asked,   “Any   salary   cut   or   sacking   of   employees   and   all?”   No.   It   will   be   totally<mask>inhuman   to  talk   about   the  salary   cut   or   sacking  and  all,   particularly   during  the   period   of<mask>pandemic, particularly the employees who are with us in a dedicated passion for so many years<mask>and all and who plan to have their careers with us and all. Banking being a service industry<mask>particularly when the employees need to have a direct contact with the staff members, those<mask>options may be discussed only when it becomes absolutely necessary, by god's grace, things<mask>did not happen so that. In fact, chairman also explained how we took care of even contract<mask>employees and watchmen and all when government allowed CSR funds can be utilized for<mask>giving some COVID-related incentives to them. We also used about Rs.90 lakhs to Rs.1 crore<mask>for that particular thing. So, we did not think of any salary cuts or sacking. Even though there<mask>was a shot in the financial year '19-20, we were able to show increased growth and also the<mask>Page 15 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>profitability even better than what we originally thought during the year beginning. So we did<mask>not consider any salary cuts or sacking or whatever it is.<mask>On  “cost  cutting  front?”  we   have  tried  various  efforts.   Wherever  the   efficiency  is  needed<mask>particularly including things like the rent, using the productivity of technology and all, we<mask>have been doing that and some amount of benefit we were able to see that on that front.<mask>He has asked about “How the financial year '21-22 will be and particularly on moratorium<mask>what was given in the last year and all?” The things have definitely improved in the current<mask>year despite we had the COVID second wave. We hope the COVID third wave should not be<mask>there,   we   pray   for  that.   And   even  if   there  is   a   COVID  wave,   we   believe   because   of   the<mask>vaccination and other things, the impact will be much lower and all, I think we should be able<mask>to have a reasonably good financial year '21-22 in all parameters including growth, slippages<mask>and all. The transcript and all are available in our website which we are continuously doing<mask>which will also help you to have an idea of what we are thinking basically on a continuous<mask>basis.<mask>And he also suggested “Interactions with the global investors and all should go.” Yes, we are<mask>on a continuous discussion. Earlier and all, we used to go in person. Now the virtual meetings<mask>have enabled us to have discussions with more and more number of the global investors. So we<mask>are   doing   that   and   we   are   able   to   keep   a   constant   communication   open   with   the   global<mask>investors and also domestic investors by and large.<mask>And he has asked, “What are all the things we have made to reduce the legal and audit fees and<mask>all?”  We  are continuously  evaluating  that  in  the coming  days,  we feel  we  are reasonably<mask>managing them. There are also a trade-off. So we cannot compromise on the quality also.<mask>When you need quality, some amount of extra premium you have to give. We take all those<mask>things into account. And we hope when we are compared with the peers and other Banks in the<mask>industry, we are keeping at track on that and ensure that no unnecessary flab is there.<mask>And thanks for offering your empanelment. If needed, we will definitely get in touch with you.<mask>Mr. Abhishek asked, “Which year AGM and all?” See, Kumbakonam Bank which was started<mask>in the year 1904. Then there were amalgamation of four Banks including one City Forward<mask>Bank,   one  Union  Bank  and  also  one   Bank  called,   Commonwealth  Bank  who's  assets  and<mask>liabilities were taken somewhere in the mid-50s. And in, initial portion the Companies Act of<mask>1881 or 1882 required in those years there were no annual general meeting but they were<mask>conducted once in two years and things like that. So, that's why we always mentioned the year<mask>in which the annual general meeting is there. And since we had multiple Banks which got<mask>amalgamated, as a practice, we are giving only the annual general meeting year and not 115 th<mask>meeting or 116th  meeting, like that we don't give because right from the beginning, this has<mask>been the practice of our Bank.<mask>Page 16 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>We had Mr. G. Sankaran who spoke at length about “The impact of COVID particularly on the<mask>impact on the Banking industry, how it has reduced the capacity to lend and also the sight of<mask>repayment, the mounting NPAs and all problems during the pandemic year and all?” And also,<mask>“Despite being in the pandemic year, he acknowledged the Bank has given its performance to<mask>the best” Thank you, Mr. Sankaran for your wishes. Particularly being a retired chief manager<mask>of the Bank, it means a lot to us and all current employees feel inspired by your wishes as<mask>We had Then Mr. Santosh Kumar Saraf. “He offered condolences to our CUBians who passed<mask>always.<mask>away during the COVID.”<mask>“He thanked for the Dividend.”<mask>“He also congratulated for the CASA increase of 27%.”<mask>He also wanted to look into “What is the savings Bank balance?” Savings Bank balance on<mask>31st, March was Rs.9,228 crores.<mask>He also asked about “The steps taken for the employees during the COVID.”<mask>And also, “He suggested not to allow people without vaccination into the branches and all.”<mask>As told by the chairman, over 99% of our people had their vaccination, and some of them are<mask>waiting for the second vaccination and all. Particularly, we thank the governments both the<mask>state government and central government and particularly the government of Tamil Nadu for<mask>helping us to get all of our team members vaccinated.<mask>I also earlier spoke about the other facilities like work-from-home. We currently don't have<mask>anybody working from home; everybody has started attending the office.<mask>And he also spoke about “Many of the important green initiatives like rainwater harvesting,<mask>renewable energy for which what are all the steps we have taken?”<mask>“What are all the steps we have taken for not to use the single use plastics and all?”<mask>I have to thank him for bringing this important point, particularly when people talk about the<mask>global warming, very important things for the sustainability and we should aspire to live in a<mask>better planet for next generations. At all our own premises, we have our rainwater harvesting<mask>thing. Wherever we are in rented premises, and where the premises where we don't have direct<mask>control, we are not in a position to do anything on that front, but we take it very seriously and<mask>all our own premises, where we have the entire building, the rainwater harvesting has been<mask>undertaken.   In   fact,   it   became   a   law   almost   10-years   back   every   building   should   have<mask>rainwater harvesting and all. We are fully in compliance with that.<mask>Page 17 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>On renewable energy, we started making our own attempts a few years back. We had got<mask>handful of branches, where we went for solar panels. So, we encountered certain technical<mask>issues. That was our plan to go for solar panels wherever it is possible, but there are certain<mask>issues on that. At the same time, we are planning to have our panels with the solar roof on a<mask>new proposed building which is expected to come up in Guindy, Chennai. So we are very<mask>serious about it and we are taking steps and doing everything which is under our control.<mask>And we happily lend for the renewable energy sources like both solar and wind. Though both<mask>the segments are doing reasonably well and all, when the windmill started in a big way about a<mask>decade back we had a good portfolio on that. And we did not have much NPA from that<mask>segment also. Similarly, after the solar started coming, we are very active in that particular<mask>segment which I want to inform you at this particular point of time. And thanks for all the<mask>wishes.<mask>Mr. Saraf also spoke about “Whether we can have over AGM through virtual mode and all.”<mask>Let's see how things pan out. Depending upon the instructions from the regulator and the<mask>government and also how things move forward, we keep your point in in our mind and we will<mask>do the best job possible on this particular agenda.<mask>We had finally Mr. K.S. Balasubramaniam who congratulated the Bank for a reasonably good<mask>2021 and all business growth in all parameters. And also he wishes for CSR spending in water<mask>tank desilting, providing oxygen concentrator and all the things he congratulated us Thank you<mask>very much, sir.<mask>explain.<mask>And also, for the technology initiatives, he appreciated.<mask>He asked the “Cost of deposits and the yield on advances have come down.” He asked us to<mask>Basically, it happens in tune with the interest rate cycle. As you all know the central Bank and<mask>particularly   directed   by   the   monetary   policy   committee,   they   tried   to   have   a   hold   on   the<mask>interest rate cycle. So, in the interest rate, is moved upward or downward and handled by<mask>various instruments by the monetary policy committee to ensure that on the mandate available<mask>to  the  Bank  to  take  care  of  the  inflation  to  support   the  growth,   all  such  things  they  take<mask>decisions on moving the interest rate up or down. Depending upon that the market interest rate,<mask>liquidity and all will change which is a market-driven parameter. So, we are into a decreasing<mask>interest rate scenario, looks like finally, it is getting stabilized. When the interest rate cycle<mask>comes down, automatically both the deposits rates and also yields will come down, and there<mask>will be surplus liquidity in the market. Because of the lower cost, once again, the economy will<mask>start picking up. That is the way with which things are managed. So, we have to just follow<mask>what is happening and align our market rate in tune with the market rates both on cost of<mask>deposits and yield on advances front.<mask>Page 18 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>Mr.   Balasubramaniam   also   asked,   why   are   we   going   for   equity   infusion.   And   he   also<mask>acknowledges this is only an enabling resolution.<mask>Once again we need this enabling resolution because whenever we have right opportunity or<mask>we need not waste time in other paperwork and all. Any permission by the shareholders, the<mask>approval will be valid for one full year. That's why we have been taking your permission for<mask>the last seven, eight years. It is almost for the last six, seven years we have not utilized that, we<mask>will use it when it is absolutely necessary.<mask>And he asked “Whether the adequate provisions have been made?” Yes, all the provisions<mask>have been made as per the regulatory norms and as per the auditors’ requirement and all.<mask>And   he   asked   “About   the   provision   coverage   ratio.”   As   we   have   disclosed   the   current<mask>provision   coverage   ratio,   including   the   technical   written   off   accounts   as   per   the   RBI<mask>guidelines, is currently about 63.57 percentage. The annual slippage ratio to closing advances<mask>for the last five years is already given. In fact, we shared with the investors and it is also on our<mask>website during our conference calls with the investors along with our fourth quarter results, we<mask>may be having almost equal to whatever we had last year, but we feel the things should get<mask>better and we are doing our best to have everything under control.<mask>He also spoke about RBI penalty on agri loan, MSME. And he also mentioned that the penalty<mask>amount is not important, it's an indication on the lapse on the management. Sir, the point is<mask>well taken, we are doing our best to keep us as one of the compliant Banks complying with the<mask>all regulatory prescriptions and the law of the land. So this is one exception, which happened<mask>which were beyond our control. We take your point and we will do our best to ensure that such<mask>an embarrassing situation will not come in future. We are doing our best to do that. I want to<mask>record it at this particular point.<mask>So he also congratulated the management on the overall performance. So, I think we have<mask>discussed about the points almost raised by all the shareholders. I once again thank every<mask>shareholder for that.<mask>Mr. Padmanabhan since he couldn't join because of the technical problem, he has given about<mask>four,   five   questions,   which   I   probably   will   answer.   “What   is   your   dividend   policy?”   So,<mask>basically, there are regulatory prescriptions on how much portion of the net  profit can be<mask>shared with the shareholders as a dividend. That is the broader prescription. We don't have any<mask>choice. We have to be in full compliance with that regulatory prescription. Apart from that, we<mask>also continuously make at track, we ensure what is going to be the future growth rate. The<mask>point is, as I explained earlier, Banks will have growth on a continuous basis and it will always<mask>require growth capital. Even the first speaker, Mr. Bhesania told, if you give more dividend,<mask>once again you have to collect it back as a share capital because the capital requirement will be<mask>on a continuous basis. So, we take into account all the future capital requirements and take a<mask>call both in terms for the growth and also for the other requirement over and above the basic<mask>regulatory  prescription  whatever that   is available,   we take  a  call  on  that.   To answer  your<mask>Page 19 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>question  straight,   it  is  determined  by the  regulatory prescription on  the  cap  which can be<mask>shared as the dividend.<mask>“Why   the   market   prices   of   our   company   gone   down   below   Rs.150   recently?”   This   is<mask>something which we don't have any control. We can only do our duty like what Lord Krishna<mask>gave it in the Bhagavad Gita, “Karmanye Vadhikaraste, Ma Phaleshou Kada Chana” So, our<mask>job is to do our duty, we are doing everything possible in our control to improve the business,<mask>keep everything in the most efficient manner, to have the efficiency and profitability ratios<mask>close to the best and all. So, to the market you fit, basically it has a lead or lag effect and other<mask>demand   and   supply   and   so   many   general   perceptions.   So,   I   can   only   say   that   on   the<mask>performances front, we are doing our best. Even in performance also, some of the things are<mask>beyond our control, but whatever it is, we are doing our best to do a best job. When I joined<mask>the Bank way back in 2003 over the last 18 years, earlier the market used to give us the price-<mask>to-book value multiple of only 0.5. So, currently, the price-to-book value is close to about two.<mask>That expansion has happened over a period of time. And the market has taken its time and<mask>rewarded the Bank. What we do is that we do our best possible in terms of the performance<mask>and then leave it to god which means the market is god. The market will decide and we hope<mask>the market will reward it at appropriate juncture.<mask>“Why   gross   and   net   NPA   is   going   up?”   So   for   this   particular   year,   it   is   because   of   the<mask>pandemic, you had a lockdown for many months. It's the industry phenomenon. On slippage<mask>front, showing some amount of upward and recovery is also not happening to the phase who<mask>would like to see because the courts and all were also shut down. And now only things are<mask>getting slowly back to the normal. So we hope things will start improving from the financial<mask>year '22-23. Once the court procedures improve, the recoveries will improve. We are also<mask>reaching towards the end of the bad impact by COVID pandemic. So we hope the incremental<mask>slippage ratio in the second half will come down assuming that there won't be any third wave<mask>of COVID. So, things should stabilize and improve from whatever we have currently.<mask>“What are all the steps taken to improve your business and net profit and all? As I told you,<mask>taking care of the existing customers, we are trying to improve our efficiency in each and<mask>every line item on a continuous basis. So, the growth also needs to pick up because we had<mask>almost one and a half, two year period of lull growth and all. So, we are now taking care of<mask>everything and also taking steps to improve the NPA recovery through various means. So,<mask>once the growth starts and also the slippages stabilizes and recovery improve, all parameters<mask>otherwise the track will come back to the normalcy. So, I request all the shareholders… this is<mask>one request I normally used to place in the AGM to include the welfare of the employees in<mask>your morning prayers, it is very much required on taking things forward.<mask>And with this, I think I have answered the questions that were discussed by the shareholders<mask>and also one e-mail from Mr. Padmanabhan who had registered earlier but could not join. So,<mask>with this a few words, I once again thank all the shareholders for the affection and ownership,<mask>which   you   show   on   us.   I   trust   this   affection   will   continue.   Your   wishes   and   prayer   will<mask>Page 20 of 22<mask>\\x0cdefinitely take the Bank from strength-to-strength and improve all the parameters in that way<mask>the shareholders wealth also. Thank all of you to participate in this AGM.<mask>Shri R. Mohan:<mask>I hope you are happy with our M.D. and CEO for his response. I thank our M.D. and CEO for<mask>his replies.<mask>City Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>K. Vaidyanathan:<mask>Good afternoon.

       " 'Thank you, Ramesh. <mask>CHAIRMAN SPEECH<mask>Esteemed   Shareholders   of   City   Union   Bank,   my   Colleagues   on   the   Board   of   the   Bank,   Statutory   Central   Auditors,<mask>Secretarial Auditors and all the shareholders participating in this e-AGM today, through Video Conferencing. Namaskaar<mask>and Hearty Welcome to all of you ! I hope all of you and your family members are keeping fine !!<mask>At the outset, let me thank you all for your presence, continued support and faith reposed in the Bank and its Management.<mask>As you may appreciate, this is an important annual event for the Bank where it engages itself with its shareholders and where<mask>they are going to vote on our resolutions set out in Notice calling this meeting. However, in view of the statutory directions<mask>issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and Securities and Exchange Board of India in the wake of COVID Pandemic<mask>we are holding the Annual General Meeting this year also in the virtual mode. The Bank has provided the Annual Report<mask>together   with   the   Notice   of   the   Annual   General   Meeting   for   the   year   ended   31 st  March,   2021   in   electronic   mode   to<mask>shareholders. With your kind permission, I shall consider it as read.<mask>Being an e-AGM, considering technical factors / restrictions on participation, I would like to be brief in my speech giving<mask>more focus on the financial performance of the Bank for FY 2021 and our Banks continued efforts in overcoming the impact<mask>of the pandemic.<mask>GLOBAL ECONOMY<mask>The global economy witnessed an unprecedented downturn in FY 2020-21 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Central banks<mask>across the Globe provided liquidity support along with various credit extension policies to a wide range of borrowers. These<mask>measures increased the momentum of economic activity in the latter part of the year. The IMF (International Monetary<mask>Fund) predicted in its April 2021 World Economic Outlook that the global economy is projected to grow at 6.0 per cent in<mask>the calendar year 2021. Since April 2021, the global economic recovery has been gaining momentum, driven mainly by<mask>major advanced economies and massive vaccination drives and stimulus packages. Inflation in major Emerging Market<mask>Economies (EME’s) has risen above the official targets, due to sustained rise in food and commodity prices. The World<mask>Trade Organization has projected an expansion of 8% in Global Merchandise Trade although they will remain below the pre-<mask>pandemic level. Cross-border services such as tourism and transportation are likely to remain subdued till the time the<mask>pandemic recedes globally, and restrictions on international travel ease resuming confidence of the passengers. A collective<mask>global effort to fight the pandemic will bring better results, than individual countries fighting alone & the G20 countries’<mask>goal of a strong, sustainable and inclusive growth is within sight and reach. <mask>Page 3 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>INDIAN ECONOMY   <mask>In India, the second wave of the pandemic has taken a serious toll both in terms of lives and livelihood of many. The<mask>recovery that had commenced in the latter half of FY 2020-21 was halted by the second wave of the pandemic that surfaced<mask>in April-May 2021. The efforts of the RBI and Government in financial inclusion have helped the State machinery in<mask>providing seamless and timely financial support to weaker sections of the society through direct benefit transfers (DBT).<mask>The Manufacturing sector & Mining sector suffered the worst with huge losses in Q1. <mask>The pharmaceuticals sector for the obvious reasons, witnessed a boom aided by the production-linked incentive scheme<mask>(PLI) introduced for bulk drugs and medical devices, which augmented the domestic pharmaceutical production and medical<mask>exports. The services sector suffered heavily in the initial period and so also the contact intensive sectors such as aviation,<mask>tourism, and hospitality. The IT sector displayed resilience amidst the pandemic. FASTags, the facility of cashless tolling<mask>which was made mandatory in February 2021 resulted in strong growth of National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC). E-<mask>commerce platform witnessed robust growth with rising waves of digitization. <mask>With Covid-19 second showing signs of decline  in  early  June  21,  and  the  likely  availability  of  sufficient  vaccines by<mask>September 2021, growth in second half of FY21-22 is likely to pick up which would trigger positive outcomes for the Indian<mask>economy. <mask>BANKING SCENARIO <mask>To   mitigate   the   financial   impact  of  Covid-19  related   disruptions,   the   Reserve   Bank   of   India   undertook   several   policy<mask>measures  to  ease  the  flow  of  credit  at  a  lower  cost  to  needy  segments.   These  measures  include  lowering  policy  rate,<mask>launching on-tap liquidity schemes and channelizing liquidity through All India Financial Institutions to resolve stressed<mask>loans to individuals, small businesses and MSME borrowers. Further, with an objective to provide more focus on inclusive<mask>development, the RBI broadened the scope of PSL (Priority Sector Lending). <mask>The Reserve Bank of India continued with its accommodative stance and undertook several measures to arrest the downturn<mask>in domestic economic  activity,  to ease  financial  conditions  and  the  functioning of financial markets  while  maintaining<mask>financial stability and the soundness of payment and settlement systems. <mask>The Reserve Bank of India on the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situations, made the<mask>following changes at its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting held on August 06, 2021:',\n",
       " \"\\uf0d8 Policy repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) unchanged 4.0 per cent. <mask>\\uf0d8 Reverse repo ratio under Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) was maintained at 3.35 percent. <mask>\\uf0d8 Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate maintained at 4.25 per cent.<mask>The health of the Banking Sector emerged as top most priority for the Reserve Bank of India as it sought to provide more<mask>cushion to the sector already ravaged by the pandemic. The timely measures of RBI have infused a sense of optimism<mask>amongst banks. Containing measures like lockdown and stoppage of transportation, which paralyzed the business enterprises<mask>had their impact on banks in terms of loan recoveries.  As said earlier plethora of steps taken by RBI and Government of<mask>Page 4 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>India  like Resolution  Plan,   ECLGS (Emergency Credit  link Guarantee Scheme)  etc.,  would  help both  banks  and their<mask>borrowers to overcome the damage caused by the pandemic. These measures along with vaccination drives and a collective<mask>effort at the global level to arrest the pandemic are all expected to propel the global economy out of woods in the year ahead.<mask>OUR BANK’S RESPONSE <mask>With the threat of the third wave of the pandemic looming large, the Bank continues to remain cautious. Safety measures like<mask>alternative work arrangements, creation of awareness among employees, fully sanitizing the environment, providing health<mask>camps for employees and their families, reducing in-person interactions, redesigning working hours through implementation<mask>of shift system etc., are taken. During the year our Bank conducted vaccination programmes at several centres including our<mask>Administrative Office covering 4663 employees constituting 99% of total eligible workforce. A high level committee by<mask>name “Quick Response Team” was also formed as directed by RBI to oversee the entire developments in the context of the<mask>spread of COVID 19.<mask>Coming to the credit side, in line with the policies of RBI & Central Government, the Bank has provided credit to MSME<mask>sector under Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) at a concessional rate to help them tide over the economic<mask>distress. The Quantum of relief provided under ECLGS is Rs. 1,960 crore covering 8,556 borrowers’ upto March 31, 2021.<mask>The   relief   provided   to   borrowers   on   repayment   of   their   loan-dues   particularly   interest   burden,   pursuant   to   regulatory<mask>directions, is a timely help to them to cope with the pressure on their strained cash flows. <mask>We always extend our support and services to all our customers improvising our products and operational efficiency using<mask>the updated technology. At the same time we ensure that our hoary tradition well established by the founders of the Bank is<mask>maintained with no compromise on the core values. <mask>MOVING TO PERFORMANCE OF YOUR BANK<mask>In the current market scenario which is largely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, your Bank recorded a reasonable growth<mask>rate during the year in comparison to previous year. In the reporting year, the biggest challenge faced by the Banking system<mask>was dealing with mounting stressed assets, restructured debts and NPA accounts. Despite these challenges, the Bank was<mask>able to post an 8% growth in its total business, with Deposits growing by 9% and Gross Advances growing by 7%. The total<mask>business of the Bank as on 31st March, 2021 stood at Rs. 81,558 crore.<mask>The Net Interest Margin or NIM of your Bank stood at 4% for the year ended   March 31, 2021. CASA stood at 29% of<mask>Deposits which improved from 25% in the previous year. Credit Deposit Ratio has recorded 83% at the end of the year. As a<mask>result, the Net Interest Income rose from Rs. 1,676 to Rs. 1,830 crore registering a growth of 9%. Your Bank’s operating<mask>profit rose from Rs. 1,341 crore to Rs.1,484 crore. Net Profit rose from Rs. 476 crore to Rs. 593 crore. The return on assets<mask>improved to 1.15% from 1% last year. <mask>PROFITABILITY<mask>DEPOSITS <mask>Page 5 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>During the year, deposits have increased from Rs.40,832 crore to Rs.44,537 crore as on 31 st March 2021 recording a growth<mask>rate of 9%. The cost of deposit of the Bank decreased from 6.20% in FY 2020 to 5.36% in FY 2021.<mask>ADVANCES<mask>As for advances, the position increased from Rs. 34,576 crore as on 31st March 2020 to Rs.37,021 crore as on 31st March<mask>2021 registering a growth rate of 7%. The yield on advances decreased from 10.76% to 9.91% during the reporting year on<mask>account of the transmission of the cut in the key rates to the borrowers, as expected of us by the Regulator. The priority<mask>sector advances stood at Rs. 20,648 crore as at 31st March 2021 as compared to previous year amount of Rs. 17,507 crore<mask>and aggregated to 56% of the Bank’s adjusted net credit which is well above the regulatory prescription of 40%. <mask>NON PERFORMING ASSETS<mask>The Gross NPA increased from 4.09% to 5.11%. With the Covid restrictions hampering the legal proceedings we could not<mask>make much progress during the year in the recovery of bad loans. The Net NPA increased to 2.97% compared to 2.29% last<mask>year. As the standstill order was in vogue in the first 9 months, bank as a prudent measure made adhoc Covid provisions<mask>every quarter.   During Q4 FY21 we utilized a sum of Rs. 309 crore from and out of the same towards provision for bad<mask>debts. Thus a net adhoc Covid provision of Rs. 31 crore was made during the year taking the total adhoc Covid provision to<mask>Rs. 156 crore. <mask>INVESTMENTS / TREASURY OPERATIONS<mask>During the year under review gross investments has increased from Rs. 9,236 crore to Rs. 9,523 crore. The total Yield on<mask>investments worked out to 8.20%. In the midst of a stressed scenario, I must acknowledge here the redemptive role played<mask>by our Treasury department. During the reporting year the Bank has booked treasury profit to the tune of Rs. 233.41 crore as<mask>against Rs. 159.60 crore last year, a handsome increase of Rs. 74 crore, by effectively manoeuvring the volatile yield<mask>movements and timely sale of securities. Further, the Non-interest income of the Bank registered a 4% growth from Rs. 680<mask>crore to Rs. 705 crore mainly on account of increase in treasury income. <mask>NET OWNED FUNDS / CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIO   <mask>     <mask>The Bank's paid-up capital stood at Rs. 73.88 crore as on 31 st March, 2021.

Keeping<mask>in mind the Covid protocols the Bank swiftly introduced “ CUB EASY” a video KYC based account opening Application in<mask>the year 2020, which has garnered tremendous response.<mask>The evolution and adoption of newer technology has led to a significant improvement in deepening the digital transmission<mask>services. During the year, “Device Binding” in Mobile banking app was introduced as an enhanced security measure to<mask>customers whereby mobile banking app can be accessed only from the registered mobile device. Today, Payment System has<mask>assumed great importance and it is considered as the lifeline of Digital Banking and in tune with the trend improvisation<mask>takes place at our end also. Our “CUB All in One App” is now fully integrated with Unified Payment Interface (UPI) & Scan<mask>and pay functionalities. Even Non-CUB customers can use this application for payment purposes.<mask> <mask>Investment options have been introduced in Net/Mobile Banking whereby customers can make investments in Sovereign<mask>Gold Bonds, Mutual Funds, IPO / Rights Application through ASBA etc. Our Bank has introduced Interoperable Card Less<mask>Cash Withdrawal (ICCW) from ATM using UPI in our NCR ATMs whereby customers can withdraw from the ATM<mask>without   using   Debit   cards.   Moreover   during   the   Covid   19   pandemic   and  lockdown,   some   of   our   staff   members   were<mask>compelled to work from Home. The Bank provided them with secured VPN (Virtual Private Network) connectivity with<mask>installation of Antivirus and Patch management solutions. <mask>RISK MANAGEMENT<mask>The Bank has in place, a sound Risk Management Architecture, established by the active involvement and supervision of<mask>Board of Directors. The Board of the Bank has constituted a Risk Management Committee, which assesses the Bank’s risk<mask>profile and key areas of risk in particular. Under the supervision of the Risk Management Committee of the Directors, the<mask>Risk   Management   Committee  of   Executives  functions  to   ensure  that   the  policy   guidelines   approved  by   the  Board   are<mask>implemented and faithfully adhered to.<mask>The Bank has a Risk Management team headed by the Chief Risk Officer, who reports directly to MD & CEO/ Risk<mask>Management Committee (RMC) of the Board. The overall risks faced by the Bank and the risk appetite are evaluated by the<mask>Risk Management Department which frames policies and procedures, verifying the models that are used for pricing products,<mask>identifying new risks etc. Risk Management practices have been aligned with the best industry practices and are adaptable to<mask>the dynamic operating environment and market conditions.<mask>The Bank is BASEL II compliant since 31 st March, 2009.

We provided Covid<mask>Relief Fund to the various municipalities and Government bodies to the extent of Rs.125 lacs. As allowed by a Circular from<mask>the Ministry of Corporate Affairs stating that any exgratia given to Temporary / Casual / Daily Wage Workers / Security<mask>Guards can be accommodated under CSR, we disbursed a sum of Rs.93 lacs to such workers in our Bank. In the current<mask>year, at the onslaught of the second wave of the pandemic, we spent a sum of Rs.3.25 crore towards supply of Oxygen<mask>concentrators to various hospitals and towards Chief Ministers Relief Fund. <mask>As in the past, the Bank has continued its contribution towards conservation of Water bodies, & conservation of rainwater<mask>for groundwater recharge. The project on recharge of groundwater focused on desiltation of older ponds for collection of<mask>water. This was conducted at various districts in Tamilnadu which also covered cleaning and deepening of various lakes and<mask>rivers particularly in Kumbakonam, to augment ground water levels and conserve water for agricultural purposes. <mask>HUMAN RESOURCE<mask>As on 31st March, 2021, the Bank had on its roll 5,843 employees including 50 Executives. The Human Resource function<mask>continued to build & provide a cordial and safe work atmosphere to all employees by implementing the Covid guidelines<mask>issued by Union Health Ministry and State Government on the staff strength at workplace. The commitment and grit shown<mask>by our employees during the testing times has been exemplary. <mask>It also needs a mention here that during the reporting year, the management of the Bank considering the risks and efforts<mask>made by all employees during hard & continuing phases of COVID pandemic, has granted COVID incentive in monetary<mask>terms to all employees of the Bank. <mask>When I acknowledge the sincere services of our employees during the pandemic times, I feel pained to mention that the bank<mask>lost six of our Cubians on account of this terrible Covid. I pay my sincere homage to them. <mask>In the context of COVID 19, considering the need to adhere to safety norms & to continue the professional development of<mask>its   employees,   the   Bank   has   developed   an   e-learning   Management   System   (LMS).   LMS   is   a  software   application   for<mask>administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of educational courses / training programmes. It facilitates<mask>online learning process at users’ convenience. Initially an audio video lecture series on various fundamental aspects of credit<mask>was presented by the MD & CEO of the Bank. This has been made available to all staff members. Audio programmes on<mask>various other topics on banking are underway.   <mask>Page 8 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>Further,   during   the   reporting   year,   the   management   of   the   Bank   has   entered   into   pay   settlements   with   CUB   Officers<mask>Association (CUBOA) and CUB Staff Union (CUBSU) containing various monetary & non-monetary benefits. In fact the<mask>settlement which is due in September 2021, was advanced and made effective from 01 st  January 2021. Further, the pay<mask>structure of all Executives was also revised w.e.f. January 2021.      <mask>I take pride in expressing the fact that our employees always stand committed to win the  trust and confidence of our<mask>customers by their courteous service. The tireless efforts of our CUBians under the challenging conditions are truly laudable.<mask>The Bank has maintained a healthy work environment right from its inception and it needs to be mentioned here that there<mask>are no instances of industrial unrest till date.<mask>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<mask>Before   I   conclude,   I   hereby   extend   my   sincere   gratitude   to   the   Reserve   Bank   of   India,   all   Govt.   bodies,   Regulatory<mask>authorities,   Shareholders,   Customers,   business   associates,   my   colleagues   on   the   Board   of   the   Bank,   Executives   and<mask>Employees of the Bank for their continued support, guidance and patronage extended to the Bank in its growth process. My<mask>sincere appreciations to both Employees Union and Officers Association for their role in ensuring a harmonious Industrial<mask>relationship.<mask>With the grace of Almighty and with all your support, I am confident that our 116 years old organisation will continue to<mask>progress with added vigor touching new horizons of growth and glory in the years to come.<mask>I hope and pray that the world emerges victorious in its undaunted fight against the pandemic very soon. <mask>My best wishes to you all once again.<mask>Moderator:\",\n",

       " \"Chairman Sir, I'm from Bombay. Sir Resolution No.8 is the QIP of Rs.500 crores, I request<mask>you to come with the rights issue rather than a QIP. The dividend of 50 paisa, that is 50%, I<mask>would like to know whether you prefer YES Bank model where to give high dividend and QIP<mask>regularly and one fine day everybody knows what happened. Another model is the Kotak Bank<mask>which gives less than one rupee dividend on Rs.1,700 share price. Rarely does a QIP and grow<mask>with its own funds. Pages 4 of annual report, in each of the five years, deposits are more than<mask>advances. If more deposits are coming, reduce the interest rate. Deposit grew by 9% where the<mask>advances grew by 7%. During the year Rs.41.7 lakhs of dividend and 14,709 shares were<mask>transferred   to   IEPF.   It's   the   shareholders   money.   You   should   try   to   identify   the   genuine<mask>shareholder. Even if you have to send someone from the nearest branch on 28th September<mask>next month Rs.64 lakhs will be transferred to IEPF. In one month do something to reduce this<mask>amount. Government is not doing anything with the shareholders money. So, 1.5 crore shares<mask>are still held in physical. What are your plans to eliminate physical shares? I also have only<mask>two   shares   in   physical   and   it's   not   worthwhile   demating   two   shares.   During   the   year,<mask>Page 9 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>provisions were Rs.891 crore and net profit was Rs.523 crores. Provisions are more than net<mask>profit by Rs.300 crores. NPA will destroy the  economy and economy is not likely to grow in<mask>the current year, although our government expects 8% growth. RBI imposes a penalty of Rs.1<mask>crore   on   discrepancies   detected   towards   soil   notes   remittance.   Who   will   levy   penalty   for<mask>discrepancies to RBI? Somebody has to make even RBI accountable. NIM of 4% is very good<mask>in a pandemic year. All three segments have done very well. I hope you will continue to do<mask>well in the future also. Our Q1 was also good for which I congratulate the entire management.<mask>Sir, I would like you to continue with virtual meeting even when physical AGM starts next<mask>year. Sir, thank you and all the best.<mask>Moderator:\",\n",

       " 'management on the eve of annual general body meeting.  Sir, I would like to know how is our<mask>Bank   impacted   in   these   past   two   years   of   COVID   time.   After   this   Corona   Virus   and<mask>subsequent lock down there is no industry untouched after the Covid so any employee have<mask>sacked, hired or any salary cut in percentage of any? And was there any salary cut was taken<mask>by the management within the pandemic period. What are the cost cutting initiatives that our<mask>Bank   has   taken?   What   is   the   view   of   the   management   going   forward   on   sustainable   and<mask>profitable growth remain challenging in the coming quarters? And RBI is keen on telling the<mask>Banks   to   provide   moratorium   and   certain   measures   they   also   provided.   So,   under   such<mask>circumstances, how do you see the net profits? I would request our management to kindly<mask>involve on like the concalls, quarterly presentations with the global investors on a regular basis<mask>which will increase the business to the Bank? What are the other expenses, legal charges and<mask>the audit fees? Myself and my team are running a legal firm in the name of in Chennai. I<mask>request yourself to kindly enroll our firm in the empanelment of the Bank and we will be glad<mask>to extend our services. I made a requested last year also but I have not received any revert back<mask>from our legal team. Since corona period was existing, I also did not made a presence on this.<mask>So I would request your goodself to include us in the empanelment. We are not able to see this<mask>year annual general body meeting be conducted now. It is more than 100 years I know that. in<mask>the notice also did not mention, in the banner also did not mention about this year annual<mask>general body meeting.<mask>Moderator:',\n",

       " \"Good   morning   sir.   I   have   lot   of   questions   to   ask   but   our   chairman   has   clarified   all   the<mask>City Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>questions. So, it is my duty to appreciate the Bank in this juncture. We hope that we will have<mask>a physical meet this year. But unfortunately the hide and seek game of COVID and we are still<mask>in the grip of COVID-19. So, globally, so many deaths and as our chairman pointed out we<mask>have   lost   six   staff   and   I   regret   very   much,   I   convey   my   deep   condolences   to   the   family<mask>members.   Because   of   this   COVID-19,   general   psychologically   and   mentally   affected   and<mask>frustration and fear of death. So, in turn, lack of interest and enthusiasm in purchasing except<mask>of day-to-day affairs essentials. So, the entire retail segment and related small scale industries<mask>and unorganic sector is much affected. So the people what they will do? They have to survive.<mask>Like   medical   bill   and   education   and   so   on   and   so   forth.   So   ultimately   they   will   simply<mask>postpone   the   repayment   of   the   Bank   loan.   It's   easy   for   them.   So   the   ultimate   sufferer   is<mask>Banking in this, in both ways; one, it is not able to lend further which is the prime activity of<mask>the Bank and because of no expansion of business and absence of new ventures. On the other<mask>side, the repayment is not forthcoming and more slippages and gross NPA increases. One Mrs.<mask>Jaya Vaidyanathan, recently I heard in Hindu, CFO in some organization. She said that NPA<mask>will zoom in the near future. Our Bank was very safe because we have not extended advances<mask>of big tickets. We used to talk every year in the AGM also.  Our concentration and more<mask>exposure   on   retailing   business   and   small   scale   industries   which   is   struggling   now   due   to<mask>pandemic. While this is a temporary phenomenon, last year also I have told, all the accounts,<mask>since I was working in this Bank, now retired staff, I know each and every account is backed<mask>by either immovable property of either business organization or the residential outs. So, it's a<mask>system-driven NPA.  Our Bank is fundamentally strong. Even in this bad scenario,  critical<mask>circumstances, we have done the best possible and I congratulate our M.D. and team of staff<mask>for their hard work that they are fundamentally strong. That is why I used to see mutual fund<mask>garner in the business organization. The mutual funds are accumulating our share. Their fund<mask>managers and business oriented. So they feel fundamentally strong and it is safe and they<mask>expect very good return in the long-term. That is why they are accumulating. We pray for the<mask>early recovery from this pandemic situation and definitely our Bank will outperform and give<mask>very good results in the coming years and I express my whole-hearted Onam greetings to<mask>Kerala brothers and sisters and customers. Thank you, sir for giving me the opportunity.<mask>our staff and employees, my name is Santosh Kumar Saraf. I am from Kolkata. First of all, my<mask>namaskar to you, sir. Hope all our directors, all our employees and all our shareholders who<mask>are attending today’s meeting are safe and in good health. I express my condolence to those<mask>employees who left us in the last year COVID time. I wish to god please give me om shanti,<mask>om shanti and help family make strong to fight and come out of this hard situation, sir. And sir,<mask>thanks management to announce very good dividend in line with RBI guideline. I hope that we<mask>will increase in the future sir. Also, I thank the management that last year our CASA deposit<mask>increased by 27% to Rs.12,981 crores. In this regard, I want to know how much amount in the<mask>savings account sir. Next sir, we have 5,040 employees. Hope all are vaccinated. If anyone not<mask>taken, what step are you taking? I request you to those who have not taken vaccine, please stop<mask>Page 11 of 22<mask>Moderator:\",\n",

I<mask>request them to go to the private hospital with their families’ sir. Next I want to know what<mask>step you have taken for our building. In our building, is there rain water harvesting and use of<mask>its water and reduce fresh water consumption. Next sir, regarding renewable energy, I want to<mask>know what step you have taken? Are you installing solar panel on the roof or anywhere to<mask>become self-dependent in power supply sir? I want to know what steps have you taken in our<mask>offices to reduce use of single plastic because single use plastic is bad for our environment sir?<mask>How many percentage of our employees still work from home and what infrastructure facilities<mask>provided so they can work in coordination with each and other?

Last I request you, sir, continue with video<mask>conference   meeting   so   I   can   attend   from   Kolkata,   somebody   can   attend   from   Bombay,<mask>somebody can attend from Salem. And also, our directors are attending from their homes. I<mask>wish and hope you will continue with this. If a physical meeting is held, not possible for video<mask>conference meeting. So I request you to please allot 15-20 minutes make a special session for<mask>pan India shareholders so they can express their views and wish for you long life, sir. Hope our<mask>Bank will improve in your leadership. Thank you sir for giving me time.<mask>economic parameters like 9% growth in deposits, 8% growth in to business, 7% increase in<mask>total asset, 9% growth in net interest income, 11% growth in gross profit, 25% growth in net<mask>profit, return on asset at 2.15%, return on equity at 10.73%, net interest margin at 4%, EPS at<mask>8.03, etc., all point to a fairly good performance amidst the impact of pandemic on the Indian<mask>economic activities. I also appreciate the need-based manner in which the CSR funds to the<mask>extent of Rs.10.95 crores have been spent during the year. Particular mention must be made<mask>about   desilting   of   many   tanks   in   Pachiyappan   area   in   Kumbakonam,   Thirukollikadu,<mask>Thirunagar, etc., on the picture shown in balance sheet before the work started and after the<mask>work was over underlines the effective use of the fund and besides the donation of oxygen<mask>concentrators to hospitals in Thanjavur, Pudukottai, Nagapattinam and various places. And<mask>also, the building community hall at Amar Seva Sangam in Tenkasi area and Swachh Bharat<mask>providing toilet facilities at public places and at various schools and stress on waste to energy<mask>is   a   special   mention.   Net   Banking   facilities,   artificial   intelligence   usage,   mobile   Banking,<mask>online   transfer   of   funds   and   digital   channels   are   quite   appreciable.   Sir,   while   the   cost   of<mask>deposits reduced to 5.36% from 6.2%, yield on advances declined to 9.91% from 10.76% due<mask>to the introduction of the ECLGS scheme with capping of 9.2% and gold loan at lower interest.<mask>Please   throw  more   light   on   this.   Segments   advances  as   per   guidelines  to   priority  section,<mask>agriculture, MSME sector and weaker sections and these sectors, the Bank should exercise<mask>more   caution.   The   capital   adequacy   ratio   is   much   more   than   the   RBI   Basel-III   norm<mask>stipulation. And our paid up capital is Rs.73.81 crores and net worth is Rs.5,799 crores. And<mask>there   is   a   deposit   growth   and   collection   efficiency   also   is   up   to   the   expectation.   In   the<mask>circumstances, why the Bank seeks the shareholders’ approval for issue of equity shares of<mask>Page 12 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>Rs.500 crores with the face value of Re.1 and at prevailing market rate to qualified institutional<mask>investors. Of course,  it is an enabling resolution, but still why should the  Bank go in for<mask>increasing the capital base? On gross NPA and net NPA, the provisioning made as at 31 st<mask>March   was   adequate   or   any   extra   provisioning   is   necessitated   by   this   time,   what   is   the<mask>provision coverage ratio at present? Operational efficiency and cost reduction should be the<mask>watch word hereafter. Any fresh slippages on the loan book, slippage into a closing advance<mask>percentage wise, restructured loan percentage wise, where it stands today. RBI has fined Bank<mask>of Rs.1 crore citing non-compliance on lending to agriculture sector, micro, small and medium<mask>enterprises, educational loans on account of waiver of margins and security requirements. It is<mask>not Rs.1 crore that matters, but certainly a lapse on the part of management. In spite of the<mask>corona effect and all these things, the Bank is doing very well and congratulations to all the<mask>staff for their excellent work because the Bank has about 6,000 staff as on date and they are all<mask>doing very well and I am a regular client of Sivananda Colony, Coimbatore branch and I am<mask>happy the customer service is excellent. So, I take this opportunity to record my sincere thanks<mask>to the management. Thanking you, sir.<mask>Moderator:',\n",

       " \"Esteemed   shareholders   of   our   Bank,   chairman   and   colleagues   on   the   board   of   the   Bank,<mask>Statutory Auditors, Secretarial Auditors and each and every one of you participating in this e-<mask>AGM today, I convey my namaskaars to all of you for participating in this meeting.<mask>Answering the questions from the shareholders during the annual general body meeting had<mask>always been a pleasure for me. It in fact reinforces the amount of the affection. Each and every<mask>shareholders and every stakeholder is an asset of our Bank. And I take this opportunity to<mask>thank all the shareholders who have now come to express their opinion. And I would like to<mask>give my answers and explanations for all the questions possible as much as I could record<mask>during your discussions.<mask>So we had Mr. Bhesania who is first. He in fact made a point on regulations and particularly<mask>on the QIP resolution, “Why we are going for QIP, why not for the rights issue?” “And what is<mask>the model of the dividend which we are looking into basically compared with a couple of other<mask>Banks?” Basically, as we have told in the notice which is basically on enabling resolution. For<mask>the past six or seven years, every year we are getting your approval. But we use it only when it<mask>is absolutely necessary and also depending upon the opportunities available. Sometimes let's<mask>say for various reasons raising capital through QIP may be beneficial to the Bank. We will<mask>consider all the aspects and also take your view and also went through a couple of rights issue<mask>in the past. So we keep all the options open and take a call depending upon what is in the best<mask>interest of the Bank. Anyway, this is only an enabling resolution. We will use it only when it is<mask>absolutely necessary and also compare favorably with the other options. So, we are just taking<mask>it as an enabling resolution. It doesn't really mean that we will be utilizing it this year or not.<mask>We don't know. Let's say we keep all the paper works ready so that if at all it is needed, we<mask>may go for it. But it is only an enabling resolution.<mask>Page 13 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>Mr. Bhesania also spoke about the deposit growth is more than the advance growth rate. “Why<mask>don't you reduce the rate of interest for the deposits and all?” It's a very fine balance. Let's say<mask>our ALCO committee looks into this aspect on continuous basis. It is very difficult to align<mask>your deposit growth and advances growth in absolute harmony. So sometimes your deposit<mask>grows than the advance growth rate actually. Also, we have to take into consideration the<mask>general economic environment, interest rate cycle and all such things depending upon that we<mask>do. But whenever there is a decreasing interest rate cycle, our deposit rates also aligns with the<mask>overall interest rate cycle and you have seen the cost of deposits and funds also have come<mask>down in the last year which is our chairman also spoke during his address. At the same time,<mask>depositors will feel that like they are getting a raw deal. So we have to balance everything in<mask>tune with the market realities and the interest rate cycle. We will be taking a call, but your<mask>point is well taken and we will keep it for our future references. <mask>And Mr. Bhesania also added about “The fund is going to particularly the unclaimed dividend<mask>and all and also shares are getting transferred to the investor educational fund and all and it's<mask>the shareholders money which we have to take extra efforts and all?” Absolutely sir ! We are<mask>doing everything under our control to contact those shareholders. Sometimes, let's say the<mask>shareholders have moved away from their address on the record, there are various reasons<mask>which are beyond our control. Only when it is becoming absolutely not possible for us to<mask>identify   the   shareholder,   we   are   doing   everything   possible   including   going   for   the<mask>advertisements and contacting through various other options available and all, we are doing<mask>that. And it is getting transferred only when it is absolutely becoming impossible for us to trace<mask>them and give it to that. But your point is well taken on that.<mask>On eliminating the physical shares also, we are continuously taking all our efforts but as you<mask>yourself agreed, ultimately it becomes the choice of the shareholder, the cost which he feels<mask>whether it is worth or not and all. So, we are taking our efforts, but since it has become any<mask>transfer of securities, particularly through market sale and all, since it can happen only through<mask>the demat form, it is only matter of time before all physical shares getting converted into<mask>electronic format, but we are also taking all our efforts.<mask>You  also  spoke  about   the  provisioning.   Yes,   it  was  a  very  difficult  year.   We   had  a  total<mask>provision of Rs.865 crores for the financial year '19-20 which increased to Rs.891 crores for<mask>financial year '20-21, of which financial year '19-20, we had about Rs.631 crores for NPA and<mask>Rs.125 crores provision for COVID. This year we made about Rs.599 crores for the NPA and<mask>Rs.31 crores for infusion for COVID. As chairman also mentioned, since you had moratorium<mask>for first nine months and also during the COVID pandemic there were backlogs in the court<mask>procedures because courts and all were locked. So there is some slackness in terms of the<mask>recovery of the NPA which will get normalized as we proceed forward.<mask>And also, Mr. Saraf spoke about RBI penalty on cash deposits. And also congratulated on 4%<mask>net   interest   margin.   And   congratulated   for   performance   in   all   segments.   And   also<mask>congratulated for the first quarter performance. And also he expressed that to continue to the<mask>virtual AGM. So, we will take a call depending upon the instructions made available by the<mask>Page 14 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>both Department Of Company Affairs, SEBI and all. All the norms will be taken into account<mask>before taking a call. Anyway, we keep your suggestion on mind.<mask>Then, we had Mr. Mani Sundaram who gave comparison provisions which I just gave the<mask>numbers to you. And also, wanted us whether we can give more dividend and all. Banking is a<mask>business when the assets grow and the Bank grows, you need the continuous infusion of the<mask>capital particularly for both future growth and also for the future requirement. And there are<mask>also clear cut guideline from RBI metrics on how much dividend we are giving and all. We<mask>take into account particularly like what is the regulatory guideline and also the requirement of<mask>the future and all. Fortunately, since we had adequate capital even during the onset of the<mask>pandemic, when many Banks had to go for capital raising on urgent basis, we had a luxury of<mask>not diluting the capital particularly during this pandemic year. So we take all the contingencies<mask>into account and all the regulatory factors into account and we take a call on that.<mask>“Expansion plan on branches?” Till financial year '19 for the previous years, we had about<mask>incremental branches of 50 per year. Our chairman said we had only two branches got opened<mask>in the last year. So, this year we are waiting and watching. We will be firming up how much of<mask>branch we will be opening in the fourth quarter and all. We also need to take into account how<mask>the third wave if at all any going to be there. So we will take appropriate call looking into the<mask>environment on step-by-step basis. And Mr. Mani Sundaram also asked about “What are all<mask>the necessary steps the Bank had taken to take care of the staffs on COVID.?” Chairman<mask>explained in detail what are all the steps we have taken. In fact, we worked closely with the<mask>government and arranged for vaccination and all. We also explained to you that 99% of the<mask>staff members who are eligible have already been vaccinated and things like that. During the<mask>lockdown period, we had enabled working from home, reduced man hours, working in shifts<mask>and also taking the COVID vaccination. The chairman also outlined in his speech. So, thanks<mask>for   your   concern   for   our   employees   particularly   on   this   front.   We   took   whatever   in   our<mask>capacity to take care of these things.<mask>We   had   Mr.   Abhishek   who   is   also   a   lawyer.   He   also   congratulated   the   Bank   on   the<mask>performance, dividend, the profit and multiple things. He also asked about “What are all the<mask>plans the Bank has for the COVID and all?” I explained, we are keeping a close watch on that.<mask>He   also   asked,   “Any   salary   cut   or   sacking   of   employees   and   all?”   No.   It   will   be   totally<mask>inhuman   to  talk   about   the  salary   cut   or   sacking  and  all,   particularly   during  the   period   of<mask>pandemic, particularly the employees who are with us in a dedicated passion for so many years<mask>and all and who plan to have their careers with us and all. Banking being a service industry<mask>particularly when the employees need to have a direct contact with the staff members, those<mask>options may be discussed only when it becomes absolutely necessary, by god's grace, things<mask>did not happen so that. In fact, chairman also explained how we took care of even contract<mask>employees and watchmen and all when government allowed CSR funds can be utilized for<mask>giving some COVID-related incentives to them. We also used about Rs.90 lakhs to Rs.1 crore<mask>for that particular thing. So, we did not think of any salary cuts or sacking. Even though there<mask>was a shot in the financial year '19-20, we were able to show increased growth and also the<mask>Page 15 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>profitability even better than what we originally thought during the year beginning. So we did<mask>not consider any salary cuts or sacking or whatever it is.<mask>On  “cost  cutting  front?”  we   have  tried  various  efforts.   Wherever  the   efficiency  is  needed<mask>particularly including things like the rent, using the productivity of technology and all, we<mask>have been doing that and some amount of benefit we were able to see that on that front.<mask>He has asked about “How the financial year '21-22 will be and particularly on moratorium<mask>what was given in the last year and all?” The things have definitely improved in the current<mask>year despite we had the COVID second wave. We hope the COVID third wave should not be<mask>there,   we   pray   for  that.   And   even  if   there  is   a   COVID  wave,   we   believe   because   of   the<mask>vaccination and other things, the impact will be much lower and all, I think we should be able<mask>to have a reasonably good financial year '21-22 in all parameters including growth, slippages<mask>and all. The transcript and all are available in our website which we are continuously doing<mask>which will also help you to have an idea of what we are thinking basically on a continuous<mask>basis.<mask>And he also suggested “Interactions with the global investors and all should go.” Yes, we are<mask>on a continuous discussion. Earlier and all, we used to go in person. Now the virtual meetings<mask>have enabled us to have discussions with more and more number of the global investors. So we<mask>are   doing   that   and   we   are   able   to   keep   a   constant   communication   open   with   the   global<mask>investors and also domestic investors by and large.<mask>And he has asked, “What are all the things we have made to reduce the legal and audit fees and<mask>all?”  We  are continuously  evaluating  that  in  the coming  days,  we feel  we  are reasonably<mask>managing them. There are also a trade-off. So we cannot compromise on the quality also.<mask>When you need quality, some amount of extra premium you have to give. We take all those<mask>things into account. And we hope when we are compared with the peers and other Banks in the<mask>industry, we are keeping at track on that and ensure that no unnecessary flab is there.<mask>And thanks for offering your empanelment. If needed, we will definitely get in touch with you.<mask>Mr. Abhishek asked, “Which year AGM and all?” See, Kumbakonam Bank which was started<mask>in the year 1904. Then there were amalgamation of four Banks including one City Forward<mask>Bank,   one  Union  Bank  and  also  one   Bank  called,   Commonwealth  Bank  who's  assets  and<mask>liabilities were taken somewhere in the mid-50s. And in, initial portion the Companies Act of<mask>1881 or 1882 required in those years there were no annual general meeting but they were<mask>conducted once in two years and things like that. So, that's why we always mentioned the year<mask>in which the annual general meeting is there. And since we had multiple Banks which got<mask>amalgamated, as a practice, we are giving only the annual general meeting year and not 115 th<mask>meeting or 116th  meeting, like that we don't give because right from the beginning, this has<mask>been the practice of our Bank.<mask>Page 16 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>We had Mr. G. Sankaran who spoke at length about “The impact of COVID particularly on the<mask>impact on the Banking industry, how it has reduced the capacity to lend and also the sight of<mask>repayment, the mounting NPAs and all problems during the pandemic year and all?” And also,<mask>“Despite being in the pandemic year, he acknowledged the Bank has given its performance to<mask>the best” Thank you, Mr. Sankaran for your wishes. Particularly being a retired chief manager<mask>of the Bank, it means a lot to us and all current employees feel inspired by your wishes as<mask>We had Then Mr. Santosh Kumar Saraf. “He offered condolences to our CUBians who passed<mask>always.<mask>away during the COVID.”<mask>“He thanked for the Dividend.”<mask>“He also congratulated for the CASA increase of 27%.”<mask>He also wanted to look into “What is the savings Bank balance?” Savings Bank balance on<mask>31st, March was Rs.9,228 crores.<mask>He also asked about “The steps taken for the employees during the COVID.”<mask>And also, “He suggested not to allow people without vaccination into the branches and all.”<mask>As told by the chairman, over 99% of our people had their vaccination, and some of them are<mask>waiting for the second vaccination and all. Particularly, we thank the governments both the<mask>state government and central government and particularly the government of Tamil Nadu for<mask>helping us to get all of our team members vaccinated.<mask>I also earlier spoke about the other facilities like work-from-home. We currently don't have<mask>anybody working from home; everybody has started attending the office.<mask>And he also spoke about “Many of the important green initiatives like rainwater harvesting,<mask>renewable energy for which what are all the steps we have taken?”<mask>“What are all the steps we have taken for not to use the single use plastics and all?”<mask>I have to thank him for bringing this important point, particularly when people talk about the<mask>global warming, very important things for the sustainability and we should aspire to live in a<mask>better planet for next generations. At all our own premises, we have our rainwater harvesting<mask>thing. Wherever we are in rented premises, and where the premises where we don't have direct<mask>control, we are not in a position to do anything on that front, but we take it very seriously and<mask>all our own premises, where we have the entire building, the rainwater harvesting has been<mask>undertaken.   In   fact,   it   became   a   law   almost   10-years   back   every   building   should   have<mask>rainwater harvesting and all. We are fully in compliance with that.<mask>Page 17 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>On renewable energy, we started making our own attempts a few years back. We had got<mask>handful of branches, where we went for solar panels. So, we encountered certain technical<mask>issues. That was our plan to go for solar panels wherever it is possible, but there are certain<mask>issues on that. At the same time, we are planning to have our panels with the solar roof on a<mask>new proposed building which is expected to come up in Guindy, Chennai. So we are very<mask>serious about it and we are taking steps and doing everything which is under our control.<mask>And we happily lend for the renewable energy sources like both solar and wind. Though both<mask>the segments are doing reasonably well and all, when the windmill started in a big way about a<mask>decade back we had a good portfolio on that. And we did not have much NPA from that<mask>segment also. Similarly, after the solar started coming, we are very active in that particular<mask>segment which I want to inform you at this particular point of time. And thanks for all the<mask>wishes.<mask>Mr. Saraf also spoke about “Whether we can have over AGM through virtual mode and all.”<mask>Let's see how things pan out. Depending upon the instructions from the regulator and the<mask>government and also how things move forward, we keep your point in in our mind and we will<mask>do the best job possible on this particular agenda.<mask>We had finally Mr. K.S. Balasubramaniam who congratulated the Bank for a reasonably good<mask>2021 and all business growth in all parameters. And also he wishes for CSR spending in water<mask>tank desilting, providing oxygen concentrator and all the things he congratulated us Thank you<mask>very much, sir.<mask>explain.<mask>And also, for the technology initiatives, he appreciated.<mask>He asked the “Cost of deposits and the yield on advances have come down.” He asked us to<mask>Basically, it happens in tune with the interest rate cycle. As you all know the central Bank and<mask>particularly   directed   by   the   monetary   policy   committee,   they   tried   to   have   a   hold   on   the<mask>interest rate cycle. So, in the interest rate, is moved upward or downward and handled by<mask>various instruments by the monetary policy committee to ensure that on the mandate available<mask>to  the  Bank  to  take  care  of  the  inflation  to  support   the  growth,   all  such  things  they  take<mask>decisions on moving the interest rate up or down. Depending upon that the market interest rate,<mask>liquidity and all will change which is a market-driven parameter. So, we are into a decreasing<mask>interest rate scenario, looks like finally, it is getting stabilized. When the interest rate cycle<mask>comes down, automatically both the deposits rates and also yields will come down, and there<mask>will be surplus liquidity in the market. Because of the lower cost, once again, the economy will<mask>start picking up. That is the way with which things are managed. So, we have to just follow<mask>what is happening and align our market rate in tune with the market rates both on cost of<mask>deposits and yield on advances front.<mask>Page 18 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>Mr.   Balasubramaniam   also   asked,   why   are   we   going   for   equity   infusion.   And   he   also<mask>acknowledges this is only an enabling resolution.<mask>Once again we need this enabling resolution because whenever we have right opportunity or<mask>we need not waste time in other paperwork and all. Any permission by the shareholders, the<mask>approval will be valid for one full year. That's why we have been taking your permission for<mask>the last seven, eight years. It is almost for the last six, seven years we have not utilized that, we<mask>will use it when it is absolutely necessary.<mask>And he asked “Whether the adequate provisions have been made?” Yes, all the provisions<mask>have been made as per the regulatory norms and as per the auditors’ requirement and all.<mask>And   he   asked   “About   the   provision   coverage   ratio.”   As   we   have   disclosed   the   current<mask>provision   coverage   ratio,   including   the   technical   written   off   accounts   as   per   the   RBI<mask>guidelines, is currently about 63.57 percentage. The annual slippage ratio to closing advances<mask>for the last five years is already given. In fact, we shared with the investors and it is also on our<mask>website during our conference calls with the investors along with our fourth quarter results, we<mask>may be having almost equal to whatever we had last year, but we feel the things should get<mask>better and we are doing our best to have everything under control.<mask>He also spoke about RBI penalty on agri loan, MSME. And he also mentioned that the penalty<mask>amount is not important, it's an indication on the lapse on the management. Sir, the point is<mask>well taken, we are doing our best to keep us as one of the compliant Banks complying with the<mask>all regulatory prescriptions and the law of the land. So this is one exception, which happened<mask>which were beyond our control. We take your point and we will do our best to ensure that such<mask>an embarrassing situation will not come in future. We are doing our best to do that. I want to<mask>record it at this particular point.<mask>So he also congratulated the management on the overall performance. So, I think we have<mask>discussed about the points almost raised by all the shareholders. I once again thank every<mask>shareholder for that.<mask>Mr. Padmanabhan since he couldn't join because of the technical problem, he has given about<mask>four,   five   questions,   which   I   probably   will   answer.   “What   is   your   dividend   policy?”   So,<mask>basically, there are regulatory prescriptions on how much portion of the net  profit can be<mask>shared with the shareholders as a dividend. That is the broader prescription. We don't have any<mask>choice. We have to be in full compliance with that regulatory prescription. Apart from that, we<mask>also continuously make at track, we ensure what is going to be the future growth rate. The<mask>point is, as I explained earlier, Banks will have growth on a continuous basis and it will always<mask>require growth capital. Even the first speaker, Mr. Bhesania told, if you give more dividend,<mask>once again you have to collect it back as a share capital because the capital requirement will be<mask>on a continuous basis. So, we take into account all the future capital requirements and take a<mask>call both in terms for the growth and also for the other requirement over and above the basic<mask>regulatory  prescription  whatever that   is available,   we take  a  call  on  that.   To answer  your<mask>Page 19 of 22<mask>\\x0cCity Union Bank Limited<m>August 19, 2021<mask>question  straight,   it  is  determined  by the  regulatory prescription on  the  cap  which can be<mask>shared as the dividend.<mask>“Why   the   market   prices   of   our   company   gone   down   below   Rs.150   recently?”   This   is<mask>something which we don't have any control. We can only do our duty like what Lord Krishna<mask>gave it in the Bhagavad Gita, “Karmanye Vadhikaraste, Ma Phaleshou Kada Chana” So, our<mask>job is to do our duty, we are doing everything possible in our control to improve the business,<mask>keep everything in the most efficient manner, to have the efficiency and profitability ratios<mask>close to the best and all. So, to the market you fit, basically it has a lead or lag effect and other<mask>demand   and   supply   and   so   many   general   perceptions.   So,   I   can   only   say   that   on   the<mask>performances front, we are doing our best. Even in performance also, some of the things are<mask>beyond our control, but whatever it is, we are doing our best to do a best job. When I joined<mask>the Bank way back in 2003 over the last 18 years, earlier the market used to give us the price-<mask>to-book value multiple of only 0.5. So, currently, the price-to-book value is close to about two.<mask>That expansion has happened over a period of time. And the market has taken its time and<mask>rewarded the Bank. What we do is that we do our best possible in terms of the performance<mask>and then leave it to god which means the market is god. The market will decide and we hope<mask>the market will reward it at appropriate juncture.<mask>“Why   gross   and   net   NPA   is   going   up?”   So   for   this   particular   year,   it   is   because   of   the<mask>pandemic, you had a lockdown for many months. It's the industry phenomenon. On slippage<mask>front, showing some amount of upward and recovery is also not happening to the phase who<mask>would like to see because the courts and all were also shut down. And now only things are<mask>getting slowly back to the normal. So we hope things will start improving from the financial<mask>year '22-23. Once the court procedures improve, the recoveries will improve. We are also<mask>reaching towards the end of the bad impact by COVID pandemic. So we hope the incremental<mask>slippage ratio in the second half will come down assuming that there won't be any third wave<mask>of COVID. So, things should stabilize and improve from whatever we have currently.<mask>“What are all the steps taken to improve your business and net profit and all? As I told you,<mask>taking care of the existing customers, we are trying to improve our efficiency in each and<mask>every line item on a continuous basis. So, the growth also needs to pick up because we had<mask>almost one and a half, two year period of lull growth and all. So, we are now taking care of<mask>everything and also taking steps to improve the NPA recovery through various means. So,<mask>once the growth starts and also the slippages stabilizes and recovery improve, all parameters<mask>otherwise the track will come back to the normalcy. So, I request all the shareholders… this is<mask>one request I normally used to place in the AGM to include the welfare of the employees in<mask>your morning prayers, it is very much required on taking things forward.<mask>And with this, I think I have answered the questions that were discussed by the shareholders<mask>and also one e-mail from Mr. Padmanabhan who had registered earlier but could not join. So,<mask>with this a few words, I once again thank all the shareholders for the affection and ownership,<mask>which   you   show   on   us.   I   trust   this   affection   will   continue.   Your   wishes   and   prayer   will<mask>Page 20 of 22<mask>\\x0cdefinitely take the Bank from strength-to-strength and improve all the parameters in that way<mask>the shareholders wealth also. Thank all of you to participate in this AGM.<mask>Shri R. Mohan:\",\n",
